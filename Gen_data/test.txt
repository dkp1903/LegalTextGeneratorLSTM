  with respect to government procurement.

  5. The provisions of this Title shall not apply to subsidies granted
  by the Parties. For purposes of this Chapter:

  (a) A federal, central or subcentral government includes any
  non-governmental body in the exercise of any regulatory,
  administrative or other governmental authority delegated to it by that
  federal, central and sub-central government;

  (b) "service suppliers" of a Party means any person of a
  Party that seeks to provide or provides a service;

  (c) "commercial presence" means:

  (i) as regards nationals, the right to set up and manage undertakings,
  which they effectively control. This shall not extend to seeking or
  taking employment in the labour market or confer a right of access to
  the labour market of another Party,

  (ii) as regards juridical persons, the right to take up and pursue the
  economic activities covered by this Chapter by means of the setting up
  and management of subsidiaries, branches or any other form of
  secondary establishment,

  and continuous link with the economy of the Community or Mexico,
  respectively;

  (f) a "national" means a natural person who is a national of

  pursuant to the decision provided for in Article 7 (3), and subject to
  any reservations stipulated therein, the measures which a Party shall
  not maintain or adopt are defined as:

  (a) limitations on the number of services suppliers whether in the
  form of numerical quotas, monopolies, exclusive service suppliers or
  the requirements of an economic needs test;

  (b) limitations on the total value of service transactions or assets
  in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic

  of an economic needs test;

  (e) limitations on the participation of foreign capital in terms of
  maximum percentage limit on foreign shareholding or the total value of
  individual or aggregate foreign investment; and

  (f) measures which require specific types of legal entities or joint

  supply a service. 1. Subject to exceptions that may derive from harmonisation of
  regulations based on agreements concluded by a Party with a third
  country providing for mutual recognition in accordance with Article
  VII of GATS, treatment accorded to services suppliers of the other
  Party shall be no less favourable than that accorded to like services
  suppliers of any third country.

  2. Treatment granted under other agreements concluded by one of the
  Parties with a third country which have been notified under Article V
  of GATS shall be excluded from this provision.

  3. If a Party enters into an agreement of the type referred to in
  paragraph 2, it shall afford adequate opportunity to the other Party
  to negotiate the benefits granted therein. 1. Each Party shall, in accordance with Article 7, grant to services
  and service suppliers of the other Party, in respect of all measures
  affecting the supply of services, treatment no less favourable than
  that it accords to its own like services and services suppliers.

  2. A Party may meet the requirement of paragraph 1 by according to
  services and service suppliers of the other Party, either formally
  identical treatment or formally different treatment to that it accords
  to its own like services and service suppliers.

  3. Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be
  considered to be less favourable if it modifies the conditions of
  competition in favour of services or service suppliers of the Party
  compared to like services or service suppliers of the other Party. 1. As provided for in paragraphs 2 to 4, the Parties shall liberalise
  trade in services between themselves, in conformity with Article V of
  GATS.

  2. From the entry into force of this Decision, neither Party shall
  adopt new, or more, discriminatory measures as regards services or
  service suppliers of the other Party, in comparison with the treatment
  accorded to its own like services or service suppliers.

  3. No later than three years following the entry into force of this
  Decision, the Joint Council shall adopt a decision providing for the
  elimination of substantially all remaining discrimination between the
  Parties in the sectors and modes of supply covered by this Chapter(1).
  That decision shall contain:

  (a) a list of commitments establishing the level of liberalisation
  which the Parties agree to grant each other at the end of a
  transitional period of ten years from the entry into force of this
  Decision;

  (b) a liberalisation calendar for each Party in order to reach at the
  end of the ten-year transitional period the level of liberalisation
  described in subparagraph (a).

  4. Except as provided for in paragraph 2, Articles 4, 5 and 6 shall
  become applicable in accordance with the calendar and subject to any
  reservations stipulated in the Parties' lists of commitments provided
  for in paragraph 3.

  5. The Joint Council may amend the liberalisation calendar and the
  list of commitments established in accordance with paragraph 3, with a
  view to remove or add exceptions. Each Party may regulate the supply of services in its territory, in so
  far as regulations do not discriminate against services and service
  suppliers of the other Party, in comparison to its own like services
  and service suppliers. 1. In principle no later than three years following the entry into
  force of this Decision, the Joint Council shall establish the
  necessary steps for the negotiation of agreements providing for the
  mutual recognition of requirements, qualifications, licenses and other
  regulations, for the purpose of the fulfilment, in whole or in part,
  by service suppliers of the criteria applied by each Party for the
  authorisation, licensing, operation and certification of service
  suppliers and, in particular, professional services.

  2. Any such agreement shall be in conformity with the relevant
  provisions of the WTO Agreement and, in particular, Article VII of
  GATS. 1. This Chapter applies to international maritime transport, including
  door to door and intermodal transport operations involving a sea-leg.

  2. The Definitions contained in Article 3 apply to this Chapter(2).

  3. In view of the existing levels of liberalisation between the
  Parties in international maritime transport:

  (a) the Parties shall continue to effectively apply the principle of
  unrestricted access to the international maritime market and traffic
  on a commercial and non-discriminatory basis;

  (b) each Party shall continue to grant to ships operated by service
  suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that
  accorded to its own ships with regard to, inter alia, access to ports,
  use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime services of the ports, as
  well as related fees and charges, customs facilities and the
  assignment of berths and facilities for loading and unloading.

  4. Each Party shall permit to service suppliers of the other Party to
  have a commercial presence in its territory under conditions of
  establishment and operation no less favourable than those accorded to
  its own service suppliers or those of any third country, whichever are
  the better, and this in conformity with the legislation and
  regulations applicable in each Party.

  5. Paragraph 4 shall become applicable in accordance with the calendar
  and subject to any reservation stipulated in the Parties' list of

  (e) limitations on the participation of foreign capital in the terms
  of maximum percentage limit on foreign shareholding or the total value

  services.

  2. No Party may adopt new measures as regards to the cross-border
  provision of financial services by financial service suppliers of the
  other Party which are more discriminatory as compared to those applied
  on the date of entry into force of this Decision.

  3. Without prejudice to other means of prudential regulation of the
  cross-border provision of financial services, a Party may require the
  registration of cross-border financial service suppliers of the other
  Party.

  4. Each Party shall permit persons located in its territory to
  purchase financial services from financial service suppliers of the
  other Party located in the territory of that other Party. This
  obligation does not require a Party to permit such suppliers to do
  business or carry on commercial operations; or to solicit, market or
  advertise their activities in its territory. Each Party may define the
  meaning of "doing business", "carry on commercial
  operations", "solicit", "market" and
  "advertise" for purposes of this obligation. 1. Each Party shall grant to the financial service suppliers of the
  other Party, including those already established in its territory on
  the date of entry into force of this Decision, treatment no less
  favourable than that it accords to its own like financial service
  suppliers with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion,
  management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of
  commercial operations of financial service suppliers in its territory.

  2. Where a Party permits the cross-border provision of a financial
  service it shall accord to the financial service suppliers of the
  other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its
  own like financial service suppliers with respect to the provision of
  such a service. 1. Each Party shall accord to financial service suppliers of the other
  Party treatment no less favourable than it accords to the like
  financial service suppliers of a non Party.

  2. Treatment granted under other agreements concluded by one of the
  Parties with a third country which have been notified under Article V
  of GATS shall be excluded from this provision.

  3. If a Party enters into an agreement of the type referred to in
  paragraph 2, it shall afford adequate opportunity to the other Party
  to negotiate the benefits granted therein. 1. No Party may require a financial service supplier of the other
  Party to engage individuals of any particular nationality as senior
  managerial or other key personnel.

  2. No Party may require that more than a simple majority of the board
  of directors of a financial service supplier of the other Party be
  composed of nationals of the Party, persons residing in the territory
  of the Party, or a combination thereof. 1. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party to
  apply:

  (a) any existing measure inconsistent with Articles 12 to 16 which is
  listed on Annex I; or

  (b) an amendment to any discriminatory measure referred to in
  subparagraph (a) to the extent that the amendment does not increase
  the inconsistency of the measure with Articles 12 to 16, as it existed
  immediately before the amendment.

  2. The measures listed in Annex I shall be reviewed by the Special
  Committee on Financial Services established under Article 23, with a
  view to propose to the Joint Council their modification, suspension or
  elimination.

  3. No later than three years following the entry into force of this
  Decision, the Joint Council shall adopt a decision providing for the
  elimination of substantially all remaining discrimination. That
  decision shall contain a list of commitments establishing the level of
  liberalisation which the Parties agree to grant each other. Each Party may regulate the supply of financial services, in so far as
  regulations do not discriminate against financial service or financial
  service suppliers of the other Party in comparison to its own like
  financial services and financial service suppliers. 1. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from
  adopting or maintaining reasonable measures for prudential reasons,
  such as:

  (a) the protection of investors, depositors, financial market
  participants, policy-holders, policy-claimants, or persons to whom a
  fiduciary duty is owed by a financial service supplier;

  (b) the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial
  responsibility of financial service suppliers; or

  (c) ensuring the integrity and stability of a Party's financial
  system.

  2. These measures shall not be more burdensome than necessary to
  achieve their aim, and shall not discriminate against financial
  service suppliers of the other Party in comparison to its own like
  financial service suppliers.

  3. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a Party to
  disclose information relating to the affairs and accounts of
  individual consumers or any confidential or proprietary information in
  the possession of public entities. 1. Each Party shall make its best endeavours to provide in advance to
  all interested persons any measure of general application that the
  Party proposes to adopt in order to allow an opportunity for such
  persons to comment on the measure. Such measure shall be provided:

  (a) by means of an official publication; or

  (b) in other written or electronic form.

  2. Each Party's appropriate financial authority shall make available
  to interested persons its requirements for completing applications
  relating to the supply of financial services.

  3. On the request of an applicant, the appropriate financial authority
  shall inform the applicant of the status of its application. If such
  authority requires additional information from the applicant, it shall
  notify the applicant without undue delay.

  4. Each Party shall make its best endeavours to ensure that the Basle
  Committee's "Core Principles for Effective Banking
  Supervision", the International Association of Insurance
  Supervisors' "Key Standards for Insurance Supervision" and
  the International Organisation of Securities Commissions'
  "Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation" are
  implemented and applied in its territory.

  5. The Parties also take note of the "Ten Key Principles for
  Information Exchange" promulgated by the Finance Ministers of the
  G7 Nations, and undertake to consider to what extent they may be
  applied in bilateral contacts. Each Party shall permit a financial service supplier of the other
  Party to provide any new financial service of a type similar to those
  services that the Party permits its own financial service suppliers to
  provide under its domestic law in like circumstances. A Party may
  determine the juridical form through which the service may be provided
  and may require authorisation for the provision of the service. Where
  such authorisation is required, a decision shall be made within a
  reasonable time and the authorisation may only be refused for
  prudential reasons. 1. Each Party shall permit a financial service supplier of the other
  Party to transfer information in electronic or other form, into and
  out of its territory, for data processing where such processing is
  required in the ordinary course of business of such financial service
  supplier.

  2. As far as the transfer of personal data is concerned, each Party
  shall adopt adequate safeguards to the protection of privacy and
  fundamental rights, and freedom of individuals in accordance with
  Article 41 of the Agreement. 1. The Joint Council hereby establishes a Special Committee on
  Financial Services. The Special Committee shall be composed of
  representatives of the Parties. The principal representative of each
  Party shall be an official of the Party's authority responsible for
  financial services set out in Annex II.

  2. The functions of the Special Committee shall include:

  (a) supervising the implementation of this Chapter;

  (b) considering issues regarding financial services that are referred
  to it by a Party;

  (c) considering the application of measures listed by either Party in
  Annex I in order to propose to the Joint Council its modification,
  suspension or elimination, as appropriate;

  (d) reviewing the provisions contained in this Chapter at such a time
  as either of the Parties may grant a third party more favourable
  access to its financial services market pursuant to the conclusion of
  a regional economic integration agreement compatible with Article V of
  GATS, with a view to proposing consequent modifications to this
  Chapter to the Joint Council; and

  (e) considering implementation of Article 16 of the Agreement.

  3. The Special Committee shall meet once a year on a date and with an
  agenda agreed in advance by the Parties. The office of chairman shall
  be held alternately. The Special Committee shall report to the Joint
  Committee the results of each annual meeting. 1. A Party may request consultations with the other Party regarding
  any matter arising under this Chapter. The other Party shall give
  sympathetic consideration to the request. The Parties shall report the
  results of their consultations to the Special Committee on Financial
  Services at its annual meeting.

  2. Consultations under this Article shall include officials of the
  authorities specified in Annex II.

  3. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require financial
  authorities participating in consultations to disclose information or
  take any action that would interfere with individual regulatory,
  supervisory, administrative or enforcement matters.

  4. Where a Party requires information for supervisory purposes
  concerning a financial service supplier in the other Party's
  territory, the Party may approach the competent financial authority in
  the other Party's territory to seek the information. Arbitrators appointed to panels established in accordance with Title V
  for disputes on prudential issues and other financial matters shall
  have the necessary expertise relevant to the specific financial
  service under dispute, as well as expertise or experience in financial
  services law or practice, which may include the regulation of
  financial institutions. 1. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party,
  including its public entities, from exclusively conducting or
  providing in its territory activities or services forming part of a
  public retirement plan or statutory system of social security, except
  when those activities may be carried out by financial service
  suppliers in competition with public entities or private institutions.

  2. Nothing in this Chapter applies to activities conducted by a
  central bank or monetary authority or by any other public entity in
  pursuit of monetary or exchange rate policies.

  3. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party,
  including its public entities, from exclusively conducting or
  providing in its territory activities or services for the account or
  with the guarantee or using the financial resources of the Party, or
  its public entities. 1. The provisions of this Title are subject to the exceptions
  contained in this Article.

  2. Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a
  manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable
  discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail, or a
  disguised restriction on trade in services, nothing in this Title
  shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any Party
  of measures:

  (a) necessary to protect public morals or to maintain public order and
  public security;

  (b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;

  (c) necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are
  not inconsistent with the provisions of this Title including those
  relating to:

  (i) the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal
  with the effects of a default on services contracts;

  (ii) the protection of the privacy of individuals in relation to the
  processing and dissemination of personal data and the protection of
  confidentiality of individual records and accounts;

  (iii) safety;

  (d) inconsistent with the objective of Article 6 and 14, provided that
  the difference in treatment is aimed at ensuring the effective or
  equitable imposition or collection of direct taxes in respect of
  services or service suppliers of the other Party.

  3. The provisions of this Title shall not apply to the Parties'
  respective social security systems or to activities in the territory
  of each Party, which are connected, even occasionally, with the
  exercise of official authority.

  4. Nothing in this Title shall prevent a Party from applying its laws,
  regulations and requirements regarding entry and stay, work, labour
  conditions, and establishment of natural persons(3) provided that, in
  so doing, it does not apply them in a manner as to nullify or impair
  the benefits accruing to the other Party under the terms of a specific
  provision of this Title. 1. For the purpose of this Title, investment made in accordance with
  the laws of the Parties means direct investment, investment in real
  estate and purchase and sale of any kind of securities, as defined in
  the OECD Codes of Liberalisation.

  2. Payments covered by this Title are those related to an investment. 1. Without prejudice to Articles 30 and 31, restrictions on payments
  related to investment between the Parties shall be progressively
  eliminated. The Parties undertake not to introduce any new
  restrictions on payments related to direct investment from the entry
  into force of this Decision.

  2. Restrictions on payments related to investments in the services
  sector which have been liberalised in accordance with Title II of this
  Decision shall be eliminated according to the same timetable. 1. Where, in exceptional circumstances, payments related to investment
  between the Parties cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties
  for the operation of the exchange rate policy or monetary policy of a
  Party, that Party may take safeguard measures that are strictly
  necessary for a period not exceeding six months. The application of
  safeguard measures may be extended through their formal
  reintroduction.

  2. The Party adopting the safeguard measure shall inform the other
  Party forthwith and present, as soon as possible, a time schedule for
  their removal. 1. Where one or more Member States or Mexico is in serious balance of
  payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the Community
  or the Member State concerned, or Mexico, as the case may be, may
  adopt restrictive measures with regard to payments, including
  transfers of proceeds from the total or partial liquidation of direct
  investment. Such measures shall be equitable, non-discriminatory, in
  good faith, of limited duration and may not go beyond what is
  necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation.

  2. The Community or the Member State concerned, or Mexico, as the case
  may be, shall inform the other Party forthwith and present, as soon as
  possible, a time schedule for their removal. Such measures shall be
  taken in accordance with other international obligations of the Party
  concerned, including those under the WTO Agreement and the Articles of
  Agreement of the International Monetary Fund. The liquidation and transfer abroad of any direct investment made in
  Mexico by Community residents or in the Community by Mexican
  residents, and of any profits stemming therefrom, shall not be
  affected by the provisions of Article 30. The Community and its Member States, within the scope of their
  respective competences, and Mexico shall aim to promote an attractive
  and stable environment for reciprocal investment. Such promotion
  should take the form, in particular, of:

  (a) mechanisms for information about and identification and
  dissemination of investment legislation and opportunities;

  (b) development of a legal framework favourable to investment on both
  sides, particularly through the conclusion, where appropriate, by the
  Member States of the Community and Mexico of bilateral agreements
  promoting and protecting investment and preventing double taxation;

  (c) development of uniform and simplified administrative procedures;
  and

  (d) development of mechanisms for joint investments, in particular
  with the small and medium enterprises of both Parties. The Community and its Member States, within the scope of their
  respective competences, and Mexico recall their international
  commitments with regard to investment, and especially the OECD Codes
  of Liberalisation and OECD National Treatment Instrument. With the view of the objective of progressive liberalisation of
  investment, the Community and its Member States, and Mexico affirm
  their commitment to review the investment legal framework, the

  interpretation of the covered legal instruments or any other matter
  that it considers might affect their operation.

  3. The Joint Committee shall convene within 30 days of delivery of the
  request and shall endeavour to resolve the dispute promptly by means
  of a decision. That decision shall specify the implementing measures
  to be taken by the Party concerned, and the period of time to do so. 1. In case a Party considers that a measure applied by the other Party
  violates the covered legal instruments and such matter has not been
  resolved within 15 days after the Joint Committee has convened
  pursuant to Article 38(3) or 45 days after the delivery of the request
  for a Joint Committee meeting, either Party may request in writing the
  establishment of an arbitration panel.

  2. The requesting Party shall state in the request the measure and
  indicate the provisions of the covered legal instruments that it
  considers relevant, and shall deliver the request to the other Party
  and to the Joint Committee. 1. The requesting Party shall notify the other Party of the

  as a chair. The other Party must then appoint a second arbitrator
  within 15 days, and propose up to 3 candidates to serve as a chair.

  2. Both Parties shall endeavour to agree on the chair within 15 days
  after the second arbitrator has been appointed.

  3. The date of establishment of the arbitration panel shall be the
  date on which the chair is appointed.

  4. If a Party fails to appoint its arbitrator pursuant to paragraph 1,
  such arbitrator shall be selected by lot from the candidates proposed.
  If the Parties are unable to agree on the chair within the time period
  referred to in paragraph 2, it shall be selected by lot within one
  week from the candidates proposed.

  5. If an arbitrator dies, withdraws or is removed, a replacement shall
  be selected within 15 days in accordance with the selection procedure
  followed to select him or her. In such a case, any time period
  applicable to the arbitration panel proceeding shall be suspended for
  a period beginning on the date the arbitrator dies, withdraws or is
  removed and ending on the date the replacement is selected. 1. The arbitration panel should, as a general rule, submit an initial
  report containing its findings and conclusions to the Parties not
  later than three months from the date of establishment of the
  arbitration panel. In no case should it do so later than five months
  from this date. Any Party may submit written comments to the

  of the report.

  2. The arbitration panel shall present to the Parties a final report
  within 30 days of presentation of the initial report.

  3. In cases of urgency, including those involving perishable goods,
  the arbitration panel shall make every effort to issue its final

  ruling on whether a case is urgent.

  4. All decisions of the arbitration panel, including the adoption of
  the final report and of any preliminary ruling, shall be taken by
  majority vote, each arbitrator having one vote.

  5. The complaining Party may withdraw its complaint at any time before
  the final report has been issued. Such withdrawal is without prejudice
  to its right to introduce a new complaint regarding the same issue at
  a later point in time. 1. Each Party shall be bound to take the measures involved in carrying
  out the final report referred to in Article 41(2).

  its implementation.

  3. The Parties shall endeavour to agree on the specific measures that
  are required for implementing the final report.

  4. The Party concerned shall promptly comply with the final report. If
  it is impracticable to comply immediately, the Parties shall endeavour
  to agree on a reasonable period of time to do so. In the absence of
  such agreement, either Party may request the original arbitration
  panel to determine the length of the reasonable period of time, in
  light of the particular circumstances of the case. The ruling of the
  arbitration panel shall be given within 15 days from that request.

  5. The Party concerned shall notify to the other Party the measures
  adopted in order to implement the final report before the expiry of
  the reasonable period of time determined in accordance with paragraph
  4. Upon that notification, any of the Parties may request the original
  arbitration panel to rule on the conformity of those measures with the
  final report. The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be given
  within 60 days from that request.

  6. If the Party concerned fails to notify the implementing measures
  before the expiry of the reasonable period of time determined in
  accordance with paragraph 4, or if the arbitration panel rules that
  the implementing measures notified by the Party concerned are
  inconsistent with the final report, such Party shall, if so requested
  by the complaining Party, enter into consultations with a view to
  agree on a mutually acceptable compensation. If no such agreement has
  been reached within 20 days from the request, the complaining Party
  shall be entitled to suspend only the application of benefits granted
  under the covered legal instruments equivalent to those affected by
  the measure found to violate the covered legal instruments.

  7. In considering what benefits to suspend, a complaining Party should
  first seek to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors as that
  affected by the measure that the panel has found to violate the
  covered legal instruments. A complaining Party that considers it is
  not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same sector or
  sectors may suspend benefits in other sectors.

  8. The complaining Party shall notify the other Party of the benefits
  which it intends to suspend no later than 60 days before the date on
  which the suspension is due to take effect. Within 15 days from that
  notification, any of the Parties may request the original arbitration
  panel to rule on whether the benefits which the complaining Party
  intends to suspend are equivalent to those affected by the measure
  found to violate the covered legal instruments, and whether the
  proposed suspension is in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7. The
  ruling of the arbitration panel shall be given within 45 days from
  that request. Benefits shall not be suspended until the arbitration
  Panel has issued its ruling.

  9. The suspension of benefits shall be temporary and shall only be
  applied by the complaining Party until the measure found to violate
  the covered legal instruments has been withdrawn or amended so as to
  bring it into conformity with the covered legal instruments, or the
  Parties have reached agreement on a resolution of the dispute.

  10. At the request of any of the Parties, the original arbitration
  panel shall rule on the conformity with the final report of any
  implementing measures adopted after the suspension of benefits and, in
  light of such ruling, whether the suspension of benefits should be
  terminated or modified. The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be
  given within 30 days from the date of that request.

  11. The rulings provided for in paragraphs 4, 5, 8 and 10 shall be
  binding. 1. Any time period mentioned in this Title may be extended by mutual
  agreement of the Parties.

  2. Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the arbitration panel
  proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the Model Rules of
  Procedure set out in Annex III. The Joint Committee may amend the
  Model Rules of Procedure.

  3. Arbitration proceedings established under this Title will not
  consider issues relating to each Party's rights and obligations under
  the WTO.

  4. Recourse to the dispute settlement provisions of this Title shall
  be without prejudice to any possible action in the WTO framework,
  including dispute settlement action. However, where a Party has, with
  regard to a particular matter, instituted a dispute settlement
  proceeding under either Article 39(1) of this Title or the WTO
  Agreement, it shall not institute a dispute settlement proceeding
  regarding the same matter under the other forum until such time as the
  first proceeding has ended. For purposes of this paragraph, dispute
  settlement proceedings under the WTO Agreement are deemed to be
  initiated by a Party's request for a panel under Article 6 of the
  Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of

Considering disparities in economic development between Jordan and the EFTA States, 

Desiring to create favourable conditions for the development and diversification of trade between them and for the promotion of commercial and economic co-operation in areas of common interest on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, non-discrimination and international law,

The Parties declare their readiness to foster, in so far as their agricultural policies allow, harmonious development of trade in agricultural products. 


2. In pursuance of this objective each individual EFTA State and Jordan concluded a bilateral arrangement providing for measures to facilitate trade in agricultural products. 


3. The Parties shall apply their regulations in sanitary and phytosanitary matters in a non-discriminatory fashion and shall not introduce any new measures that have the effect of unduly obstructing trade. 1. The Parties commit themselves to apply any internal taxes and other charges and regulations in accordance with Article III of the GATT 1994 and other relevant WTO Agreements. 


2. Exporters may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on products exported to the territory of one of the Parties. 1. Payments relating to trade between an EFTA State and Jordan and the transfer of such payments to the territory of the Party where the creditor resides, shall be free from any restrictions. 


2. The Parties shall refrain from any currency exchange or administrative restrictions on the grant, repayment or acceptance of short and medium-term credits covering commercial transactions in which a resident participates. 


3. No restrictive measures shall apply to transfers related to investments and in particular to the repatriation of amounts invested or reinvested and of any kind of revenues stemming therefrom. 1. The Parties consider the effective liberalisation of their respective public procurement markets on the basis of non-discrimination and reciprocity, as an integral objective of this Agreement. 


2. To this effect, the Parties shall elaborate rules within the framework of the Joint Committee with a view to ensuring such liberalisation.  Due account shall be given to developments under the auspices of the WTO. 


3. The Parties concerned shall endeavour to accede to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement. 1. The Parties shall grant and ensure adequate, effective and non-discriminatory protection of intellectual property rights, and provide for measures for the enforcement of such rights against infringement thereof, counterfeiting and piracy, in accordance with the provisions of this Article, Annex VI to this Agreement and the international agreements referred to therein. 


2. The Parties shall accord to each others’ nationals treatment no less favourable than that they accord to their own nationals. Exemptions from this obligation must be in accordance with the substantive provisions of Article 3 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (hereinafter “the TRIPS Agreement”). 


3. The Parties shall grant to each others’ nationals treatment no less favourable than that accorded to nationals of any other State.  In accordance with Article 4, paragraph (d) of the TRIPS Agreement, any advantage, favour, privilege or immunity deriving from international agreements in force before this Agreement and notified to the other Parties at the latest six months after the entry into force of this Agreement, shall be exempted from this obligation, provided that it does not constitute an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination of nationals of the other Parties.  The Parties shall be exempted from the notification if they have already made such notification to the TRIPS Council. Exemptions from this obligation must be in accordance with the substantive provisions of the TRIPS Agreement, in particular Articles 4 and 5 thereof. 


4. The Parties agree, upon request of any Party, to review the provisions on the protection of intellectual property rights contained in the present Article and in Annex VI, with a view to further improve levels of protection and to avoid or remedy trade distortions caused by actual levels of protection of intellectual property rights. 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between an EFTA State and Jordan: 


(a) 	all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition; 


(b) 	abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Parties as a whole or in a substantial part thereof. 

2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to the activities of public undertakings, and undertakings for which the Parties grant special or exclusive rights, in so far as the application of these provisions does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them. 


3. If a Party, within five years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, considers that a given practice referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 causes, or threatens to cause, serious prejudice to its interest or material injury to its domestic industry, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25. 


4. The Joint Committee shall, taking into account the economic situation of Jordan, decide whether the period referred to in paragraph 3 should be extended for further periods of five years. 


5. Without prejudice to paragraph 4, following the expiry of the period set out in paragraph 3, a Party that considers that a given practice is incompatible with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25. 1. The rights and obligations of the Parties' relating to subsidies and countervailing measures shall be governed by Article XVI of the GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, except as otherwise provided in this Article. 


2. The Parties shall ensure transparency of subsidy measures by exchanging their annual notifications to the WTO pursuant to Article XVI:1 of the GATT 1994 and Article 25 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.  


3. Before an EFTA State or Jordan, as the case may be, initiates an investigation to determine the existence, degree and effect of any alleged subsidy in Jordan, or in an EFTA State, as provided for in Article 11 of the Agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures, the Party considering initiating an investigation shall notify in writing the Party whose goods are subject to investigation and allow for a 45 day period of consultations from the receipt of notification with a view to finding a mutually acceptable solution. The consultations shall take place in the Joint Committee, if any Party so requests, within 20 days from the receipt of the notification. If an EFTA State finds that dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the GATT 1994 is taking place in trade with Jordan, or if Jordan finds that dumping within this meaning is taking place in trade with an EFTA State, the Party concerned may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the GATT 1994 and with the procedure laid down in Article 25. Where any product is being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause: 


(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products in all or part of the territory of one of the Parties, or 


(b) 	serious disturbances in any sector of the economy, 
the Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 25. 1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the provisions of Article 4 may be taken by Jordan in the form of an increase or reintroduction of customs duties. 


2. These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where these difficulties produce major social problems. 


3. After the introduction of these measures, the total ad valorem customs duties applicable in Jordan to products originating in the EFTA States may not exceed 25% and shall maintain an element of preference for products originating in the EFTA States.  The total yearly average value of imports of the products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 20% of the total yearly average value of imports of industrial products originating in the EFTA States during the last three years for which statistics are available. 


4. These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding five years unless a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee. They shall cease to apply at the latest on the expiry of the maximum transitional period of twelve years. 


5. No such measures may be introduced in respect of a product if more than four years have elapsed since the elimination of all duties and quantitative restrictions or charges or measures having equivalent effect concerning that product. 


6. Jordan shall inform the Joint Committee of any exceptional measures it intends to take and, at the request of the EFTA States, consultations shall be held on such measures and the sectors to which they apply before they are implemented.  When taking such measures Jordan shall provide the Joint Committee with a timetable for the elimination of the customs duties introduced under this Article.  This timetable shall provide for a phasing out of these duties in equal annual instalments starting at the latest two years after their introduction. The Joint Committee may decide on a different timetable.  


7. By way of derogation from paragraph 5 of this Article, the Joint Committee may exceptionally, in order to take account of the difficulties involved in setting up a new industry and when certain sectors are undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, authorize Jordan to maintain the measures already taken pursuant to paragraph 1 for a maximum period of three years beyond the twelve-year transitional period. Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 8 and 9 leads to: 


(a) 	re-export to a third country against which the exporting Party maintains, for the product concerned, quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect; or 


(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to the exporting Party; 
and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25. The measures shall be non-discriminatory and be eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 1. The Parties shall endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance of payments purposes. 


2. A Party in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the GATT 1994 and the Understanding on the Balance-of-Payments Provisions of the GATT 1994, adopt trade restrictive measures, which shall be of limited duration and non-discriminatory, and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. Preference shall be given to price-based measures which shall be progressively relaxed as balance of payments conditions improve and eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance.  The EFTA State or Jordan, as the case may be, shall inform the other Parties and the Joint Committee forthwith, if possible, prior to their introduction and shall provide a time schedule for their removal. The Joint Committee shall, upon the request of any other Party, examine the need for maintaining the measures taken. 1. Before initiating the procedure for the application of safeguard measures set out in the following paragraphs, the Parties shall endeavour to solve any differences between them through direct consultations, and inform the other Parties thereof. 


2. Without prejudice to paragraph 6, a Party which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the other Parties and the Joint Committee thereof and supply all relevant information. Consultations between the Parties shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution. 


3. 	(a) As regards Articles 18 the Parties concerned shall give to the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to.  If the Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement after consultations, or after thirty days following referral for such consultations, the Party concerned may adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from the practice in question. 


(b) 	As regards Article 20, the exporting Party shall be informed of the dumping case as soon as the authorities of the importing Party have initiated an investigation. Where no end has been put to the dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the GATT 1994 or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the notification being made, the importing Party may adopt appropriate measures. 


(c) 	As regards Article 21 and 23, the Joint Committee shall examine the case or the situation and may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the Party concerned.  In the absence of such a decision within thirty days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the Party concerned may adopt the measures necessary in order to remedy the situation. 


(d) 	As regards Article 32, the Party concerned shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a commonly acceptable solution. If the Joint Committee fails to reach such a solution or if a period of ninety days has elapsed from the date of notification, the Party concerned may take appropriate measures. 

4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the Parties and to the Joint Committee.  They shall be restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their 

application and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice or the difficulty in question. Priority shall be given to such measures that will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement.  The measures taken by Jordan against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect the trade with that State. The measures taken against an action or omission of Jordan may only be taken by that or those EFTA States the trade of which is affected by the said action or omission. 

5. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, substitution or abolition, when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 


6. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Party concerned may, in the cases of Articles 20, 21 and 23 apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.  The measures shall be notified without delay and consultations between the Parties shall take place as soon as possible within the Joint Committee. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Party from taking any measures which it considers necessary: 


(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; 


(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the implementation of international obligations or national policies 


(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes, and to such traffic in other goods, materials and services as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; or 


(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and chemical weapons, nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; or 
(iii) 	taken in time of war or other serious international tension. 1. The Parties undertake to review the present Agreement in light of further developments in international economic relations, i.a. in the framework of the WTO and to examine in this context, and in the light of any relevant factor, the possibility of further developing and deepening the co-operation under this Agreement and to extend it to areas not covered therein. The Parties may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this possibility and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with a view to opening up negotiations. 


2. Agreements resulting from the procedure referred to in paragraph 1 will be subject to ratification or approval by the Parties in accordance with their own procedures. 1. The Parties recognise the growing importance of certain areas, such as services and investments.  In their efforts to gradually develop and broaden their co-operation, in particular in the context of Euro-Mediterranean integration, they will co-operate with the aim of further promoting investments and achieving a gradual liberalization and mutual opening of markets for trade in services, taking into account on-going work under the auspices of the WTO. 


2. The EFTA States and Jordan shall review developments in the services sectors with a view to considering liberalisation measures between the parties. 


3. The EFTA States and Jordan will discuss this co-operation in the Joint Committee with the aim of developing and deepening their relations under this Agreement. 1. The implementation of this Agreement shall be supervised and administered by a Joint Committee, consisting of the representatives of the Parties, which shall simultaneously act under the Declaration signed in Geneva in June 1997. 


2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of this Agreement, the Parties shall exchange information and, at the request of any Party, shall hold consultations 

within the Joint Committee.  The Joint Committee shall keep under review the possibility of further removal of the obstacles to trade and further cooperation under this Agreement. 

3. The Joint Committee may take decisions in the cases provided for in this Agreement.  On other matters the Joint Committee may make recommendations. 1. For the proper implementation of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall meet whenever necessary but normally once a year.  Each Party may request that a meeting be held. 


2. 	The Joint Committee shall act by common agreement. 


3. If a representative in the Joint Committee of a Party has accepted a decision subject to the fulfilment of constitutional requirements, the decision shall enter into force, if no later date is contained therein, on the date the lifting of the reservation is notified. 


4. For the purpose of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure which shall, inter alia, contain provisions for convening meetings and for the designation of the Chairman and his/her term of office.1 


5. The Joint Committee may decide to set up such sub-committees and working parties as it considers necessary to assist it in accomplishing its tasks.2 1. The Parties shall at all times endeavour to agree on the interpretation and application of this Agreement, and shall make every attempt through co-operation and consultations to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of any matter that might affect its operation. 


2. Any Party may request in writing consultations with any other Party regarding any actual or proposed measure or any other matter that it considers might affect the 
1 	Rules of procedure were adopted by Joint Committee Decision No. 1 of 2004 (26 February 2004) 

2 	A Sub-Committee on customs and Origin Matters was established by Joint Committee Decision No. 2 of 2004 (26 February 2004) 

operation of this Agreement.  The Party requesting consultations shall at the same time notify the other Parties in writing thereof and supply all relevant information. 


3. The consultations shall take place in the Joint Committee if any of the Parties so request within 20 days from the receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 2, with a view to find a commonly acceptable solution. 


4. Disputes between the Parties, relating to the interpretation of rights and obligations of the Parties, which have not been settled through direct consultations or in the Joint Committee within 90 days, from the date of the receipt of the request for consultations, may be referred to arbitration by one or more Parties to the dispute by means of a written notification addressed to the Party complained against.  A copy of this notification shall be communicated to all Parties. 


5. The constitution and functioning of the arbitral tribunal is governed by Annex VII. 


6. The arbitral tribunal shall settle the dispute in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, interpreted and applied in accordance with the customary rules of interpretation of public international law. 


7. The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding upon the Parties to the dispute. 1. The Parties shall take all necessary measures to ensure the achievement of the objectives of this Agreement and the fulfilment of their obligations under this Agreement. 


2. If an EFTA State considers that Jordan has, or if Jordan considers that an EFTA State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Agreement, the Party concerned may take the appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25. The Annexes and the Protocols to this Agreement are an integral part of it. The Joint Committee may decide to amend the Annexes and Protocols. This Agreement applies to trade and economic relations between, on the one side, the individual EFTA States and, on the other side, Jordan, but not to the trade relations between individual EFTA States, except if otherwise provided for in this Agreement. This Agreement shall apply to the territories of the Parties except as provided for in Protocol D. This Agreement shall not prevent the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free trade areas, arrangements for frontier trade and other preferential agreements to the extent that these do not negatively affect the trade regime provided for by this Agreement. 1. Amendments to this Agreement other than those referred to in Article 33 shall, after approval by the Joint Committee, be submitted to the Parties for acceptance, ratification or approval.

Preamble 


The Kingdom of Sweden and the Republic of Estonia, 


Recalling the importance of the traditional links between Sweden and 
Estonia and the common values they share, and recognizing their wish to 
strengthen these links and to establish close and lasting relations, 


Desiring to create favourable conditions for the development and 
diversification of trade between them and for the promotion of commercial 
and economic co-operation in areas of common interest on the basis of 
equality, mutual benefit and international law, 


Having regard to the Declaration signed by the EFTA States and Estonia 
on 10 December 1991, 


Having regard to the Trade Agreement between Sweden and Estonia signed 
on 28 October 1991, in particular to the provision contained therein that 
the Parties shall accord most-favoured-nation treatment to each other, and 
to the objective expressed in that Agreement to establish free trade 
between the two countries, 


Reaffirming their commitment to pluralistic democracy based on the 
rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and sharing the 
principles of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and 
Co-operation in Europe, the Concluding Documents of the Madrid and Vienna 
meetings, the Document of the Bonn Conference on Economic Co-operation in 
Europe, and the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, 


Having regard to the emerging process of economic liberalization 
taking place in Estonia aimed at the establishment of a market economy, 
thus facilitating the integration of Estonia into the European and world 
economy, 


Resolved to develop further their relations in the field of trade in 
accordance with the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, 


Considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as 
exempting the Parties from their obligations under other international 
agreements, 


Having agreed as follows: The objectives of this Agreement are: 



(a) 	to promote, through the establishment of free trade according to 
the provisions of this Agreement, the harmonious development cf 
economic relations between Sweden and Estonia, and thus to foster 
the expansion of reciprocal trade, the advance of economic 
activity, the improvement of living and employment conditions, 
increased productivity, and financial stability; 



(b) 	to promote fair conditions of competition in the mutual trade 
between Sweden and Estonia; 



(c) 	to contribute, in this way, to European economic integration and 
the harmonious development and expansion of world trade. This Agreement shall apply to products falling within Chapters 25 to 
97 of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, which 
originate in Sweden or in Estonia. 1. Protocol A¹ lays down the rules of origin and related methods of 
administrative co-operation. 



2. The Parties shall take appropriate measures, including arrangements 
for administrative co-operation, to ensure that the provisions of 
Articles 4 (Prohibition and abolition of customs duties and charges having 
equivalent effect), 5 (Prohibition and abolition of quantitative 
restrictions and measures having equivalent effect), 8 (Internal taxation), 
and 17 (Re-export and serious shortage), and Protocol A are effectively and 
harmoniously applied, and to reduce, as far as possible, the formalities 
imposed on trade, and to achieve mutually satisfactory solutions to any 
difficulties arising act of the operation of those provisions. 1. No new customs duty on imports and exports or charges having 
equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between Sweden and Estonia. 



2. Customs duties on imports and exports and charges having equivalent 
effect shall be abolished upon the entry into force of this Agreement. 



3. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to customs duties of a 
fiscal nature. 

¹Available for consultation in the secretariat (office 2078) 1. No new quantitative restrictions on imports and exports or measures 
having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between Sweden and 
Estonia. 



2. Quantitative restrictions on imports and exports and measures having 
equivalent effect shall be abolished upon the entry into force of this 
Agreement except as provided for in Annex I. This Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on 
imports, exports, or goods in transit, justified on grounds of public 
morality, public policy, or public security; protection of the health and 
life of humans, animals, or plants; protection of the environment; 
protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic, or 
archaeological value; protection of intellectual property; or rules 
relating to gold or silver. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, 
however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised 
restriction on trade between the Parties. 1. The Parties declare their readiness to foster, in so far as their 
agricultural policies allow, the harmonious development of trade in 
agricultural products. 



2. In pursuance of this objective the Parties will conclude an 
arrangement providing for measures to facilitate trade in agricultural 
products and to establish free trade with respect to specific agricultural, 
specific processed agricultural, and specific fish products. 



3. The Parties shall apply their regulations in veterinary, plant health 
and health matters in a non-discriminatory fashion, and shall not introduce 
any new measures that unduly obstruct trade. 1. The Parties shall refrain from any measure or practice of an internal 
fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or indirectly, discrimination 
between products originating in one Party and like products originating in 
the other Party. 



2. Products exported to the territory of one of the Parties may not 
benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of 
direct or indirect taxation imposed on them. 1. Payments relating to trade in goods and the transfer of such payments 
to the territory of the Party where the creditor resides shall be free from 
any restrictions. Payments between the Parties shall be effected in freely 
convertible currencies, unless otherwise agreed by specific companies in 
specific cases. 



2. The Parties shall refrain from any currency exchange restrictions or 
administrative restrictions on the grant, repayment, or acceptance of short 
and medium-term credits covering commercial transactions in which a 
resident participates. 1. The Parties shall not maintain or introduce export aid as listed in 
Annex Il. 



2. The Parties shall make best endeavours to ensure fair competition in 
their mutual trade. Rules between the Parties concerning competition 
between enterprises, other State aid than export aid, and public 
procurement shall be elaborated and put into effect not later than 
31 December 1995. 



3. If a Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is 
incompatible with paragraph 1, it may take appropriate measures under the 
conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 19 
(Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). 1. The Parties to this Agreement shall co-operate with the aim of 
gradually improving the non-discriminatory protection of intellectual 


property rights, including measures for the grant and enforcement of such 


rights. Rules between the Parties concerning the protection of 


intellectual property rights shall be elaborated and put into effect not 


later than 31 December 1995. These rules shall ensure a level of 


protection similar to that prevailing in the Member States of the European 


Communities and in the Member States of the European Free Trade 


Association. 


2. With respect to paragraph 1 of this Article, intellectual property 
rights shall include, in particular, protection of copyright, comprising 
computer programmes, databases, and neighboring rights; trademarks; 
geographical indications; industrial designs; patents; topographies of 
integrated circuits; as welI as undisclosed information on know-how. The Parties shall promote trade and economic co-operation between 
them, including fostering a favourable climate for investments, joint 
ventures, and sub-contracting, and facilitating trade promotion activities. The Parties undertake to examine, in the light of any relevant factor, 
the possibility of further developing and deepening the co-operation under 
this Agreement and to extend it to areas not covered therein. If a Party finds that dumping is taking place in trade relations 
governed by this Agreement, it may take the appropriate measures against 
that practice in accordance with Article VI of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade and agreements related to that Article, under the 
conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 19 
(Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). If an increase in imports of a given product originating in Sweden or 
Estonia occurs in quantities or under conditions which cause, or are likely 
to cause: 



(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly 
competitive products in the territory of the other Party, or 



(b) 	serious disturbances in any related sector of the economy or 
difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the 
economic situation of a region, 

the Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions 
and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 19 
(Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). 1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the 
provisions of Article 4 may be taken by Estonia in the form of customs 
duties. 



2. These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors 
undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where 
these difficulties produce important social problems. 



3. Customs duties on imports applicable in Estonia to products 
originating in Sweden, introduced by these measures, may not exceed 25 per 
cent ad valorem. Such customs duties shall maintain an element of 
preference for products originating in Sweden, and they may not exceed 
customs duties levied on the imports to Estonia of similar goods from any 
other country. The total value of imports of the products which are 
subject to these measures may not exceed 15 per cent of total imports of 
industrial products from Sweden, as defined in Article 2, during the last 
year for which statistics are available. 



4. These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding five years 
unless a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee, and cannot 
be introduced later than five years after entry into force of this 
Agreement. 



5. Estonia shall inform the Joint Committee of any exceptional measures 
it intends to take and, at the request of Sweden, consultations shall be 
held in the Joint Committee on such measures and the sectors to which they 
apply before the measures are introduced. When taking such measures 
Estonia shall provide the Joint Committee with a schedule for the 
elimination of the customs duties introduced under this Article. The 
schedule shall provide for a phasing out of these duties starting at the 
latest two years after their introduction at equal annual rates. The Joint 
Committee may decide on a different schedule. Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 leads to: 


(a) 	re-export towards a third country against which the exporting 
Party maintains, for the product concerned, quantitative export 


restrictions, export duties, or measures or charges having 


equivalent effect; or 


(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to 
the exporting Party; 


and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to 
give rise to major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party 
may take the appropriate measures under the conditions and in 
accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 19 (Procedure for 
the application of safeguard measures). 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 4 and 5, a Party may, 
consistently with its other international obligations, introduce 
restrictive measures on trade if it is in serious balance-of-payments 
difficulties or under imminent threat thereof. Such measures shall be of a 
temporary nature. 



2. Measures taken in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall be 
notified to the Joint Committee, if possible prior to their introduction. 
The Joint Committee shall, upon the request of the other Party, examine the 
need for maintaining the measures taken. 1. Before initiating the procedure for the application of safeguard 
measures set out in this Article, the Parties shall endeavour to solve any 
differences between them through direct consultations. 



2. Without prejudice to paragraph 5 of this Article, a Party which 
considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the Joint 
Committee thereof and supply all relevant information. Consultations shall 
take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a 
mutually acceptable solution. 



(a) 	As regards Article 10 (State aid, and rules of competition and 
public procurement), the Party concerned shall give to the Joint 
Committee all the assistance required for the examination of the 
case and shall, where appropriate, eliminate the practice 
objected to. If the Party in question fails to put an end to the 
practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint 
Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement 
within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Party 
concerned may adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the 
difficulties resulting from the practice in question. 



(b) 	As regards Articles 14 (Dumping), 15 (Emergency action on imports 
of particular products), and 17 (Re-export and serious shortage), 
the Joint Committee shall examine the situation and may take any 
decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the 
Party concerned. In the absence of such decision within thirty 
days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the 
Party concerned may adopt the measures necessary in order to 
remedy the situation. 



(c) 	As regards Article 22 (Fulfilment of obligations), the Party 
concerned may take appropriate measures after the consultations 
have been concluded or a period of three months has elapsed from 
the date of notification. 


3. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the 
Joint Committee. They shall be restricted with regard to their extent and 
to their duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the 
situation giving rise to their application and shall not be in excess of 
the injury caused by the practice or the difficulty in question. Priority 
shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of 
the Agreement. 



4. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular 
consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, 
substitution, or abolition as soon as possible. 



5. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior 
examination impossible, the Party concerned may, in the cases of 
Articles 10 (State aid, and rules of competition and public procurement), 14 
(Dumping), 15 (Emergency action on imports of particular products), and 17 
(Re-export and serious shortage), apply forthwith the precautionary 
measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation. The measures shall be 
notified without delay, and consultations between the Parties shall take 
place as soon as possible within the Joint Committee. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Party from taking any 
measures which it considers necessary: 



(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its 
essential security interests; 



(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the 
implementation of international obligations or national policies: 

(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition, and 
implements of war, provided that such measures do not 


impair the conditions of competition in respect of 
products not intended for specifically military purposes, 
and to such traffic in other goods, materials, and 
services as is carried on directly or indirectly for the 
purpose of supplying a military establishment; or 


(ii) relating to the non-proliferation of biological and 


chemical weapons, nuclear weapons, or other nuclear 
explosive devices; or 


(iii) 	taken in time of war or other serious international 
tension. 1. The implementation of this Agreement shall be supervised and 
administered by a Joint Committee. 



2. The Joint Committee shall consist of representatives of Sweden on the 
one hand, and of representatives of Estonia, on the other. It shall act by 
mutual agreement and shall meet whenever necessary but at least once a 
year. Each Party may request that a meeting be held. 



3. The Committee may decide to amend the Annexes I and II and the 
Protocol A to this Agreement. 



4. The Joint Committee may decide to set up such sub-committees and 
working parties as it considers necessary to assist it in accomplishing its 
tasks. 1. The Parties to this Agreement shall take all necessary measures to 
ensure the achievement of the objectives of the Agreement and the 
fulfilment of their obligations under the Agreement. 



2. If either Party considers that the other Party has failed to fulfil an 
obligation under this Agreement, the Party concerned may take the 
appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the 

procedures laid down in Article 19 (Procedure for the application of 
safeguard measures). The Annexes I and II and the Protocol A to this Agreement are an 
integral part of it. A Memorandum of Understanding is attached to the

Carl Bildt Tiit Vähi
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EFTA COUNTRIES AND SPAIN 


Information Furnished by the Parties to the Agreement 1.	 This report covers the period from 1 May 1980 to 31 December 1982. 



2. The Agreement between the EFTA countries and Spain - including the 
bilateral agreements concluded in accordance with Article 9 concerning 
trade in agricultural products - which entered into force on 1 May 1980, 
has been applied in accordance with its provisions. 



3. The objective of the Agreement is to reduce progressively and to 
eliminate the obstacles to substantially all the trade between the EFTA 
countries and Spain in accordance with the provisions of the GATT 
concerning the establishment of free-trade areas. 



4.	 The main results of the Agreement are as follows: 



(a)	 The first tariff reductions under the Agreement were made on 
1 July 1980. As a result, the level of liberalization achieved 
so far by virtue of the Agreement generally corresponds to the 
level of liberalization under the 1970 Agreement between Spain 
and'the EEC. In accordance with Annex I of the EFTA-Spain 
Agreement the EFTA countries, except for Portugal for which 
country there are special provisions (Annex P to the Agreement), 
have reduced their duties on almost all industrial products 
imported from Spain by 60 per cent. Spain has reduced its duties 
by 60 per cent on the imports of the products in List A of 
Annex II to the Agreement and by 25 per cent on products in 
Lists B and C. Furthermore, there have been sizeable tariff 
reductions on certain processed agricultural goods and on some 
food products. 



(b)	 In accordance with Annex V to the Agreement, Spain has increased 
the import quotas by at least 10 per cent annually. 



(c)	 In accordance with the special provisions concerning trade 
between Portugal and Spain set out in Annex P to the Agreement, 
Portugal has progressively reduced tariffs on imports of 
products originating in Spain. Total reductions range from 

20 per cent to 60 per cent. Spanish reductions vis-à-vis 
Portugal amount to from 10 to 75 per cent. The products for 
which these tariff reductions have been made, together with the 
time schedule followed, are contained in lists included in the 
Agreement. 


The rules of origin in Annex III to the Agreement which 
determine the eligibility of products for the tariff reduction 
under the Agreement have been applied as foreseen. In 
accordance with the provisions of this Annex the rules have, 
in specific cases, been amended and supplemented in order to 
facilitate their implementation and application. 


The Joint Committee established to administer the Agreement 
and to supervise its implementation has met five times. During 
these meetings two annual reviews of the Agreement have been 
made and the Decisions taken are listed at Annex. 


In 1982 the Joint Committee undertook the comprehensive 
examination foreseen in paragraph 2 of Article 3 of the 
Agreement, with a view to finding additional ways and means to 
achieve substantial progress in the further elimination of 
obstacles to trade. It was noted that for products on which 
tariff reductions have been agreed upon in the MTN, the EFTA 
countries applied the resulting lower rates as the basic duties 
for tariff reductions under the Agreement. Consequently, the 
real tariff reductions had been greater than denoted by the 
relevant provisions of the Agreement. As concerns the tariff 
reductions undertaken by Spain, the basic duties were the rate 
of duty actually applied to third States by Spain at any given 
time, e.g. either the autonomous rate of the Spanish customs 
tariff or, if lower, the rate prescribed by the rules of the 
GATT. Furthermore, it was recognized that the negotiations 
on the accession of Spain to the European Communities were at 
an advanced stage and, as the Free Trade Agreements between 
the EFTA countries and the Communities will become applicable 
also to trade with Spain, these negotiations had to be seen 
as constituting a step towards achieving the objective of the 
Agreement. 


Commercial incidence: approximately 81 per cent of the imports 
of the EFTA countries from Spain are covered by the Agreement. 
On exports from the EFTA countries to Spain the figure is 
approximately 97 per cent.

procedures laid down in Article 20. 1. 	Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 5 and Article 


6, a Party may, consistently with its other international 
obligations, introduce restrictive measures on trade if 


it is in serious balance of payments difficulties or 


under imminent threat thereof. Such measures shall be of 


a temporary nature. 


2. 	Measures taken in accordance with paragraph 1 of this 


Article shall be notified to the Joint Committee, if 


possible prior to their introduction. The Joint Committee 
shall, upon the request of the other Party, examine the 


need for maintaining the measures taken. 1. 	Before initiating the procedure for the application of 


safeguard measures set out in this Article, the Parties

give to the Joint Committee all the assistance 


required for the examiniation of the case and shall,

the practice objected to within the period fixed by

matter being referred to it, the Party concerned may


adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the 


difficulties resulting from the practice in 


question.

shall examine the situation and may take any


decision needed to put an end to the difficulties 
notified by the Party concerned. In the absence of 


such decision within thirty days of the matter being
referred to the Joint Committee, the Party concerned 
may adopt the measures necessary in order to remedy


the situation. 


(c) As regards Article 24, the Party concerned may take 


appropriate measures after the consultations have 


been concluded or a period of three months has 
elapsed from the date of notification. 


3. 	The safeguard measures taken shall be notified 
immediately to the Joint Committee. They shall be 


restricted with regard to their extent and to their 


duration to what is strictly necessary in order to 


rectify the situation giving rise to their application


and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the 


practice or the difficulty in question. Priority shall be 


given to such measures as will least disturb the 
functioning of the Agreement. 


4. 	The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of 


regular consultations within the Joint Committee with a 


view 	to their relaxation, substitution, or abolition as 


soon 	as possible.

action make prior examination impossible, the Party


concerned may, in the cases of Article 11, 16, 17 and 18

necessary to remedy the situation. The measures shall be 


notified without delay, and consultations between the 


Parties shall take place as soon as possible within the 


Joint Committee. The Parties agree that exceptional measures of limited 


duration which derogate from the provisions of Article 5 


may be taken by Estonia in the form of increased customs 


duties in accordance with Annex IV. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Party from 


taking any measures which it considers necessary:

in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 29 (Procedure for the Application of Safeguard Measures). 1. Any aid granted by a Party to this Agreement or through state resources in any form whatever, which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it may affect trade between the Parties, be incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement. 


2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to products referred to in Chapter II. 


3. The Parties shall ensure transparency in the area of state aid, inter alia, by reporting annually to the Joint Committee on the total amount and the distribution of the aid given and by providing to the other Party, upon request, information on aid schemes and on particular individual cases of state aid. 


4. If a Party considers that a particular practice: 
-is incompatible with the terms of paragraph 1;  or 

-causes or threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interest of that Party or material injury to its domestic industry, 

it may take appropriate measures under the conditions of and in accordance with the provisions of Article 29 (Procedure for the Application of Safeguard Measures).  Such appropriate measures may only be taken in conformity with the procedures and under the conditions laid down by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and by the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization and any other relevant instruments negotiated under their auspices which are applicable between the Parties. 1. The Parties consider the liberalization of their respective public procurement markets as an objective of this Agreement. 


2. The Parties shall progressively develop their respective regulations for public procurement with a view to grant suppliers of the other Party, on 1 January 2001 at the latest, access to contract award procedures on their respective public procurement markets according to the provisions of the Agreement on Government Procurement in Annex IV to the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization. 


3. The Joint Committee shall examine developments related to the achievement of the objectives of this Article and may recommend practical modalities of implementing the provisions of paragraph 2 so as to ensure free access, transparency and full balance of rights and obligations.

5. The Parties shall endeavour to accede to the relevant Agreements negotiated under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization. 1. The Parties shall grant and ensure the protection of intellectual property rights on a nondiscriminatory basis, including measures for granting and enforcing such rights.  The protection shall be gradually improved on a level corresponding to the substantive standards of the multilateral agreements which are specified in Annex VI to this Agreement by 1 January 1999 at the latest. 


2. For the purposes of this Agreement, "intellectual property protection "includes, in particular, protection of copyright, comprising computer programs and databases, and neighbouring rights, trademarks for goods and services, geographical indications including appellation of origin, industrial designs, patents, topographies of integrated circuits, as well as undisclosed information on know-how. 


3. The Parties shall co-operate in matters of intellectual property. They shall hold, upon request of any Party, expert consultations on these matters, in particular, on activities relating to the existing or to future international conventions on harmonization, administration and enforcement of intellectual property and on activities in international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization, as well as relations of the Parties with any third country on matters concerning intellectual property. 


4. The Parties may conclude further agreements exceeding the requirements of this Agreement which are not contrary to TRIPS Agreement. If a Party finds that dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 is taking place in trade relations governed by this Agreement, it may take appropriate measures against that practice in accordance with Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 29 (Procedure for the Application of Safeguard Measures). Where any product is being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause: 


(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products in the territory of the importing Party;  or 


(b) 	serious disturbances in any related sector of the economy or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region; 
the Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 29 (Procedure for the Application of Safeguard Measures). 1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the provisions of Article 3 (Customs Duties on Imports and Charges having Equivalent Effect) may be taken by any of the Parties in the form of increased customs duties. 


2. These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where these difficulties produce important social problems. 


3. Customs duties on imports applicable in the Party concerned to products originating in the other Party introduced by these measures may not exceed 25 per cent ad valorem and shall maintain an element of preference for products originating in the other Party. The total value of imports of the products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 15 per cent of total imports of industrial products from the other Party as defined in Chapter I during the last year for which statistics are available. 


4. These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding two years, unless longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee.  They shall cease to apply on 1 January 2001 at the latest. 


5. No such measures can be introduced in respect of a product if more than three years have elapsed since the entry into force of this Agreement or elimination of all customs duties and quantitative restrictions or charges or measures having an equivalent effect concerning that product. 


6. The Party concerned shall inform the other Party of any exceptional measures it intends to take and, upon request of the other Party, consultations shall be held within the Joint Committee on such measures and the sectors to which they apply prior their introduction.  When taking such measures the Party concerned shall provide the Joint Committee with a schedule for the elimination of the customs duties introduced under this Article. This schedule shall provide for a phasing out of these customs duties starting at the latest one year after their introduction. The Joint Committee may decide on a different schedule. Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 6 (Customs Duties on Exports and Charges having Equivalent Effect) and 8 (Quantitative Restrictions on Exports and Measures having Equivalent Effect) leads to: 


(a) 	re-export towards a third country against which the exporting Party maintains for the product concerned quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect; or 


(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to the exporting Party; 
and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 29 (Procedure for the Application of Safeguard Measures). 1. The Parties shall take any general or specific measures required to fulfil their obligations under this Agreement.  They shall see to it that the objectives set out in this Agreement are attained. 


2. If a Party considers that the other Party has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Agreement, the Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 29 (Procedure for the Application of Safeguard Measures). 1. Before initiating the procedure for the application of safeguard measures set out in the following paragraphs of this Article, the Parties shall endeavour to solve any differences between them through direct consultations. 


2. In the event of a Party subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the situation referred to in Article 25 (General Safeguards) to an administrative procedure having as its purpose the rapid provision of information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Party. 


3. Without prejudice to paragraph 7 of this Article, a Party which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the other Party thereof and supply all relevant information. Consultations between the Parties shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a solution. 


4. 


(a) 	With regard to Articles 24 (Dumping), 25 (General Safeguards) and 27 (Re-Export and Serious Shortage), the Joint Committee shall examine the case or the situation and may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the Party concerned.  In the case of the absence of such decision within thirty days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee the Party concerned may adopt the measures necessary in order to remedy the situation. 


(b) 	With regard to Article 28 (Fulfilment of Obligations), the Party concerned may take appropriate measures after the consultations have been concluded or a period of three months has elapsed from the date of the first notification to the other Party. 


(c) 	With regard to Articles 20 (Rules of Competition concerning Undertakings) and 21 (Staid Aid), the Party concerned shall give the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to.  If the Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement within forty five days of the matter being referred to it, the Party concerned may adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from the practice in question. 

5. The safeguard measures taken shall be immediately notified to the other Party.  They shall be restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their application and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice or the difficulty in question.  Priority shall be given to such measures which will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. 


6. The safeguard measures taken shall be the subject of periodic consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation as soon as possible, or abolition when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 


7. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Party concerned may, in the cases of Articles 20 (Rules of Competition concerning Undertakings), 21 (State Aid) and 30 (Balance-of-Payments Difficulties), apply forthwith the provisional measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.  The measures shall be notified without delay and consultations between the Parties shall take place as soon as possible within the Joint Committee. 1. The Parties shall endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures including measures relating to imports for balance-of-payments purposes. 


2. Where one of the Parties is in serious balance-of-payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the Party concerned may, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and with Article VIII of Articles of the Agreement of International Monetary Fund adopt restrictive measures, including measures related to imports, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance-of-payments situation.  The measures shall be progressively relaxed as balance-of-payments conditions improve and they shall be eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. The Party concerned shall inform the other Party forthwith of their introduction and, whenever practicable, of a schedule for their removal. 1. Where a Party considers that it would be useful in the interests of the economies of the Parties to develop and deepen the relations established by this Agreement by extending them to fields not covered thereby, it shall submit a reasonable request to the other Party.  The Parties may instruct the Joint Committee to examine such a request and, where appropriate, to make recommendations, particularly with a view to opening negotiations.

Annexes and the Protocol to this Agreement are an integral part of it.

which the State Parties to this Agreement grant special or exclusive rights, in so far as the application 
of these provisions does not obstruct the performance, in law or fact, of their particular public tasks. 



3. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is incompatible with this Article, 
it may take measures it considers necessary to deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the 
practices in question under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 

25. 1. Any aid granted by a State Party to this Agreement or through State resources in any form 
whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the 


production of certain goods shall, in so far as it may affect trade between an EFTA State and Poland, 
be incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement. 



2. Any practices contrary to paragraph 1 should be assessed on the basis of the criteria set out 
in Annex XIII. 



3. For the purpose of applying the provisions of paragraph 1, Poland may until 31 December

on Tariffs and Trade is taking place in its trade with Poland, or if Poland finds that dumping within

appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of 
Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and with the procedure laid down in 
Article 25. Where any product is being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions 
as to cause, or threaten to cause: 



(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products in the 
territory of the importing State Party to this Agreement, or 



(b) 	serious disturbances in any sector of the economy or difficulties which could bring 
about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, 

the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with 
the procedure laid down in Article 25. 1. ExceptionalmeasuresoflimiteddurationwhichderogatefromtheprovisionsofArticle4may

and the sectors to which they apply before they are applied. When taking such measures Poland shall 
provide the Joint Committee with a schedule for the elimination ofthe customs duties introducedunder 
this Article. This schedule shall provide for a phasing out of these duties starting at the latest two 
years after their introduction, at equal annual rates. The Joint Committee may decide on a different 
schedule. Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 7 and 9 leads to: 



(a) 	re-export towards a third country against which the exporting State Party to this 
Agreement maintains for theproduct concernedquantitativeexport restrictions, export 
duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect; or 



(b) 	aseriousshortage,orthreatthereof,ofaproductessentialtotheexportingStateParty

and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for 
the exporting Party, that State Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in 
accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25. 1. WhereanEFTAStateorPolandisinseriousbalanceofpaymentsdifficulties,orunderimminent

established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, adopt trade restrictive measures, which

situation. The measures shall be progressively relaxed as balance of payments conditions improve 
and they shall be eliminated when conditions no longer justify this maintenance. The EFTA State or 
Poland, as the case may be, shall inform the other States Parties to this Agreement and the Joint 
Committee forthwith of their introduction and, whenever practicable, of a time schedule for their 
removal. 



2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall, nevertheless, endeavour to avoid the imposition 
of restrictive measures for balance of payments purposes. 1. Before initiating the procedure for the application of safeguard measures set out in this Article, 
the States Parties to this Agreement shall endeavour to solve any differences between them through 
direct consultations, and inform the other States Parties to this Agreement thereof. 



2. Withoutprejudicetoparagraph6ofthisArticle,aStatePartytothisAgreementwhichconsiders 
resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the other States Parties to this Agreement and 
the Joint Committee thereof and supply all relevant information. Consultations between the States 
Parties to this Agreement shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding 
a commonly acceptable solution. 

3. 

(a) 

As regards Articles 18 and 19, the States Parties concerned shall give to the Joint 




Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where 




appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to. 

If the State Party in question fails to 




put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee 




or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement within three months ofthe matter 




being referred to it, the State Party concerned may adopt the appropriate measures 




to deal with the difficulties resulting from 

the practice in question. 


(b) 

As regards Articles 20, 21 and 23, the Joint Committee shall examine the case or the 




situation and may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified 




by the State Party concerned. In the absence of such a decision within thirty days of 




the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the State Party concerned may adopt 




the measures necessary in order to remedy the situation. 


(c) 

As regards Article 31, the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures after 




the consultations have been concluded or a period of three months has elapsed from 
the date of notification. 


4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the States Parties to this Agreement 
and to the Joint Committee. The measures shall be restricted with regard to their extent and to their 


duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their application 
and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice or the difficulty in question. Priority 
shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. The measures 
taken by Poland against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect the trade with 
that State. The measures taken against an action or omission of Poland may be only taken by that 
or those EFTA States the trade of which is affected by the said action or omission. 



5. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular consultations within the Joint 
Committee with a view to their relaxation, substitution or abolition as soon as possible. 



6. Whereexceptionalcircumstancesrequiringimmediateactionmakepriorexaminationimpossible,

a direct and immediate incidence on trade between the States Parties, apply forthwith the precautionary 
measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation. The measures shall be notified without delay and 
consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place as soon as possible within 
the Joint Committee. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a State Party to this Agreement from taking any measures 
which it considers necessary: 



(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; 



(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the implementation of 
international obligations or national policies 



(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war, provided

products not intended for specifically military purposes, and to such traffic 
in other goods, materials and services as is carried on directly or indirectly 
for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; or 



(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and chemical weapons, nuclear 
weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; or

necessary but at least once a year. Each State Party to this Agreement may request that a meeting 
be held. 



2. The Joint Committee shall act by common agreement.

5. The Joint Committee may decide to set up such sub-committees and working parties as it 
considers necessary to assist it in accomplishing its tasks. 1. Where a State Party to this Agreement considers that it would be useful in the interests of the 
economies of the States Parties to this Agreement to develop and deepen the relations established by 
the Agreement by extending them to fields not covered thereby, it shall submit a reasoned request to 
the States Parties to this Agreement. The States Parties to this Agreement may instruct the Joint 
Committee to examine this request and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, 
particularly with a view to opening negotiations.

as services and investments. In their efforts to gradually develop and broaden their co-operation, in 
particular in the context of European integration, they will co-operate with the aim of achieving a 
progressive liberalizationandmutual openingofmarkets forinvestmentsandtrade inservices, taking

PREMABLE 


The Swiss Confederation 	(hereinafter called Switzerland) 


and 


The Republic of Estonia 	(hereinafter called Estonia), 


Recalling their intention to participate actively in the process of 
economic integration in Europe and expressing their preparedness to 
co-operate in seeking ways and means to strengthen this process, 


Having regard to the Declaration signed by the EFTA States and Estonia 
in Geneva on 10 December 1991, 


Recalling the Trade Agreement between Switzerland and Estonia signed 
on 14 October 1925, 


Recalling their firm commitment to the Final Act of the Conference on 
Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Charter of Paris for a new Europe, 
and in particular the principles contained in the final document of the 
CSCE Eonn Conference on Economic Co-operation in Europe, 


Reaffirming their commitment to pluralistic democracy based on the 
rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, 


Desiring to create favourable conditions for the development and 
diversification of trade between them and for the promotion of commercial 
and economic co-operation in areas of common interest on the basis of 
equality, mutual benefit, most favoured nation treatment and international 
law, 


Resolved to contribute to the strengthening of the multilateral 
trading system and to develop their relations in the field of trade in 
accordance with the basic principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) having in mind the objective of Estonia to become a 
Contracting Party of the GATT, 


Declaring their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant 
factor, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations in 
order to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement, 


Have decided, in pursuit of the above, to conclude this Agreement: 1. Switzerland and Estonia shall, taking into account the need to ensure 
the accelerated transition to market economy in Estonia, give effect to 
free trade in accordance with the provisions of the present Agreement. 



2. The objectives of this Agreement, which is based on trade relations 
between market economies, are: 



(a) 	to promote, through the expansion of mutual trade, the harmonious 
development of the economic relations between Switzerland and 
Estonia and thus to foster in Switzerland and in Estonia the 
advance of economic activity, the improvement of living and 
employment conditions, increased productivity, financial 
stability and sustainable growth; 



(b) 	to provide fair conditions of competition for trade between 
Switzerland and Estonia; 



(c) 	to contribute in this way, by the removal of barriers to trade, 
to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade. The Agreement shall apply: 



(a) 	to products falling within Chapters 25 to 97 of the Harmonized 
Commodity Description and Coding System, excluding the products 
listed in Annex I; 



(b) 	to products specified in Protocol A, with due regard to the 
arrangements provided for in that Protocol; 



(c) 	to fish and other marine products as provided for in Annex II; 

originating in Switzerland or Estonia. 1. Protocol B lays down the rules of origin and methods of administrative 
co-operation. 



2. The Parties to this Agreement shall take appropriate measures, 
including regular reviews by the Joint Committee and arrangements for 
administrative co-operation, to ensure that the provisions of Article 4 

(Prohibition and Abolition of Customs Duties on Imports) to 6 (Prohibition 
and Abolition of Quantitative Restrictions on Imports or Exports), 
8 (Internal Taxation) and 20 (Re-export and Serious Shortage) of the 
Agreement and Protocol B are effectively and harmoniously applied, and to 
reduce, as far as possible, the formalities imposed on trade, and to 
achieve mutually satisfactory solutions to any difficulties arising from 
the operation of those provisions. 1. No new customs duty on imports or charge having equivalent effect 
shall be introduced in trade between Switzerland and Estonia. 



2. Customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect shall 
be abolished upon the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 



3. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to customs duties of a 

fiscal nature except as provided for in Protocol C. The Parties to this 
Agreement may replace a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal 
element of a customs duty by an internal tax. 1. No new customs duty on exports or charge having equivalent effect 
shall be introduced in trade between Switzerland and Estonia. 



2. Customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect shall 
be abolished upon the entry into force of this Agreement. 1. No new quantitative restriction on imports or exports and measures 


having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between Switzerland 
and Estonia. 


2. Quantitative restrictions on imports or exports and treasures having 
equivalent effect shall be abolished on the date of entry into force of 
this Agreement, except as provided for in Annex III. The goods of the territory of one Contracting Party imported into the 
territory of the other Contracting Party shall be accorded treatment no 
less favourable than that accorded to like goods of national origin in 
respect of all laws, regulations and requirements affecting their internal 
sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution or use. 1. The Parties to this Agreement shall refrain from any measure or 
practice of an internal fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or 
indirectly, discrimination between the products originating in one Party 
and like products originating in the other Party. 



2. Products exported to the territory of one of the Parties may not 
benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of 
direct or indirect taxation imposed on them. This Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on 
imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public 
morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and 
life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of the environment; the 
protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or 
archaeological value; the protection of intellectual property; rules 
relating to gold or silver. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, 
however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised 
restriction on trade between the Parties to this Agreement. 1. The Parties shall ensure that any state monopoly of a commercial 
character be adjusted, subject to the provisions laid down in Protocol D, 
so that no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are 
procured and marketed will exist between nationals of Switzerland and of 
Estonia. These goods shall be procured and marketed in accordance with 
commercial considerations. 



2. The provisions of this Article shall apply to any body through which 
the competent authorities of the Parties to this Agreement, in law or in 

fact, either directly or indirectly supervise, determine or appreciably 
influence imports or exports between the Parties to this Agreement. These 
provisions shall likewise apply to monopolies delegated by the State to 
others. 1. The Parties to this Agreement declare their readiness to foster, in so 
far as their agricultural policies allow, harmonious development of trade 
in agricultural products. 



2. In pursuance of this objective, measures to facilitate trade and 
co-operation in the field of agriculture will be decided upon by the 
Parties to this Agreement based on recommendations of the Joint Committee. 



3. The Parties to this Agreement shall apply their regulations in 
veterinary, plant health and health matters in a non-discriminatory fashion 
and shall not introduce any new measures that have the effect of unduly 
obstructing trade. 1. Payments relating to trade and the transfer of such payments to the 
territory of the Party to this Agreement where the creditor resides shall 
be free from any restrictions. 



2. The Parties shall refrain from any currency exchange or administrative 

restrictions on the grant, repayment or acceptance of short and medium term 
credits covering commercial transactions in which a resident participates. 1. The Parties to this Agreement consider the effective liberalization of 
their respective public procurement markets as an integral objective of 
this Agreement. 



2. To this effect, the Parties shall elaborate rules within the Joint 
Committee with a view to ensure such a liberalization not later than 
31 December 1995. 



3. The Party to this Agreement concerned shall endeavour to accede to the 
relevant agreements negotiated under the auspices of the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade. 1. In order to achieve the objectives of this Agreement, the Parties 
shall grant and ensure adequate, effective and non-discriminatory 
protection of intellectual property rights. They shall adopt and take 
adequate, effective and non-discriminatory measures for the enforcement of 
such rights against infringement thereof, and in particular against 
counterfeiting and piracy. Particular obligations of the Parties shall be 
listed in Annex IV. 



2. The Parties to this Agreement shall take, as soon as possible after 
the entry into force of the Agreement, all necessary measures to comply 
with the substantive provisions of the multilateral conventions which are 
specified in Article 2 of Annex IV and make best endeavours to re-establish 
membership, or adhere to them respectively, as well as to multilateral 
agreements facilitating co-operation in the field of protection of 
intellectual property rights. 



3. In the field of intellectual property, the Parties to this Agreement 
shall not grant treatment less favourable to each other's nationals than 
that accorded to nationals of any other State. Any advantage, favour, 
privilege or immunity deriving from: 



(a) 	existing bilateral agreements concluded by a Party to this 
Agreement before the entry into force of this Agreement, as 
notified to the other Party within one year from the date of 
entry into force of this Agreement, 



(b) 	existing and future regional agreements on economic integration 
to which not all of the Parties are parties, 

may be exempted from this obligation, provided that such agreement does not 
constitute an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination of nationals of the 
other Party. 



4. The Parties to this Agreement may conclude further agreements 
exceeding the requirements of this Agreement. 



5. The Parties to this Agreement shall agree upon appropriate modalities 
for technical assistance and co-operation of respective authorities of the 
Parties. To this end, they shall co-ordinate efforts with relevant 
international organizations. 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this 
Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between Switzerland and 
Estonia: 



(a) 	all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of 
undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which 
have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or 
distortion of competition; 



(b) 	abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the 
territories of the Parties to this Agreement as a whole or in a 
substantial part thereof. 

2. If a Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is 
incompatible with the provisions of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate 
measures after consultations within the Joint Committee or after thirty 
days following referral for such consultations. 1. Any aid granted by a Party to this Agreement or through State 
resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort 
competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain 
goods shall, in so far as it may affect trade between Switzerland and 
Estonia, be incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement. In 
particular, the Parties shall not maintain or introduce export aid as 
listed in Annex V. 



2. The Parties to this Agreement shall ensure transparency of state aid 
measures by exchanging information on the request of either Party to this 
Agreement. 



3. The Joint Committee shall keep the situation regarding the application 
of state aid measures under review, and shall elaborate further rules of 
implementation which shall be applicable not later than 31 December 1995. 



4. If a Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is 
incompatible with paragraph 1 of this Article, it may take appropriate 
measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid 
down in Article 22 (Safeguard Procedure). 



5. The Party to this Agreement concerned shall endeavour to accede to the 
relevant agreements negotiated under the auspices of the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade. 1. If a Party finds that dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is taking place in trade relations 
governed by this Agreement, it may take appropriate measures against that 
practice in accordance with that Article and agreements related thereto, 
under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in 
Article 22 (Safeguard Procedure). 



2. The Party to this Agreement concerned shall endeavour to accede to the 
relevant agreements negotiated under the auspices of the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade. If an increase in imports of a given product originating in 
Switzerland or in Estonia occurs in quantities or under conditions which 
cause, or are likely to cause: 



(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly 
competitive products in the territory of the other Party, or 



(b) 	serious disturbances in any related sector of the economy or 
difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the 
economic situation of a region, 

the Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and 
in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 22 (Safeguard 
Procedure). The Parties agree that exceptional measures of limited duration which 
derogate from the provisions of the Article 4 (Prohibition and Abolition of 
Customs Duties on Imports) may be taken by Estornia in the form of increased 
customs duties under the conditions and in accordance with Annex VI. Where compliance with the provisions of Article 5 (Prohibition and 
Abolition of Customs Duties on Exports) and 6 (Prohibition and Abolition of 
Quantitative Restrictions on Imports and Exports) leads to: 



(a) 	re-export towards a third country against which the exporting 
Party to this Agreement maintains for the product concerned 
quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or 
charges having equivalent effect; or 



(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to 
the exporting Party to this Agreement; 

and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give 
rise to major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party may take 
appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the 
procedures laid down in Article 22 (Safeguard Procedure). 1. Where Switzerland or Estonia is in serious balance of payments 
difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, Switzerland or Estonia, as 
the case may be, may, in accordance with the terms and conditions 
established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and associated 
legal instruments, adopt trade restrictive measures, which shall be of 
limited duration and non-discriminatory, and may not go beyond what is 
necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The Parties shall 
give preference to price-based measures. The measures shall be 
progressively relaxed as balance of payments conditions improve and they 
shall be eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 
Switzerland or Estonia, as the case may be, shall inform the Joint 
Committee forthwith of their introduction and of a time schedule for their 
removal. 



2. The Parties to this Agreement shall, nevertheless, endeavour to avoid

Recalling their intention to participate actively in the process of economic integration in Europe and expressing their preparedness to co-operate in seeking ways and means to strengthen this process, 

Considering the importance of the links existing between the EFTA States and Lithuania, in particular the Declaration signed in Geneva in December 1991, and recognizing the common wish to strengthen these links, thus establishing close and lasting relations, 

Recalling their firm commitment to the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Charter of Paris for a new Europe, and in particular the principles contained in the final document of the CSCE Bonn Conference on Economic Co-operation in Europe, 

Reaffirming their commitment to pluralistic democracy based on the rule of law, human rights, including rights of persons belonging to minorities, and fundamental freedoms, and recalling their membership in the Council of Europe, 

Desiring to create favourable conditions for the development and diversification of trade between them and for the promotion of commercial and economic co-operation in areas of common interest on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, most-favoured-nation treatment and international law, 

Resolved to contribute to the strengthening of the multilateral trading system and to develop their relations in the field of trade in accordance with the principles of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), Lithuania having the objective to become a Member of WTO, 

Considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the States Parties to this Agreement from their obligations under other international agreements, especially WTO, 

Determined to implement this Free Trade Agreement with the objective to preserve and protect the environment and to ensure an optimal use of natural resources in accordance with the principle of sustainable growth, 

Firmly convinced that this Free Trade Agreement will foster the creation of an enlarged and harmonious free trade area within Europe, thus constituting an important contribution to European integration, 

Declaring their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant factor, the possibility of developing and deepening their economic relations in order to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement, 

HAVE DECIDED, in pursuit of the above, to conclude the following Agreement (hereinafter called this Agreement): 1. TheEFTAStatesandLithuaniashallestablishafreetradeareainaccordancewiththeprovisions of the present Agreement.

(b) 	to provide fair conditions of competition for trade between the States Parties to this Agreement; 


(c) 	to contribute in this way, by the removal of barriers to trade, to European economic integration and to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade. This Agreement shall apply:

(b) 	to products specified in Protocol A, with due regard to the arrangements provided for in that Protocol; 


(c) 	to fish and other marine products as provided for in Annex II; 
originating in an EFTA State or Lithuania. 1. 	Protocol B lays down the rules of origin and methods of administrative co-operation. 


2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall take appropriate measures, including regular reviews by the Joint Committee and arrangements for administrative co-operation, to ensure that the provisions of Articles 4 (Customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect), 5 (Basic duties), 6 (Customs duties of a fiscal nature), 7 (Customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect), 8 (Quantitative restrictions on imports or exports and measures having equivalent effect), 13 (Internal taxation) and 22 (Re-export and serious shortage) of this Agreement and Protocol B are effectively and harmoniously applied, and to reduce, as far as possible, the formalities imposed on trade, and to achieve mutually satisfactory solutions to any difficulties arising from the operation of those provisions. 


3. A first review referred to in paragraph 2 will take place within one year after the entry into force of this Agreement. Subsequent reviews shall take place every second year. On the basis of these reviews, the States Parties to this Agreement shall decide on the appropriate measures to be taken. 1. No new customs duty on imports or charge having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the EFTA States and Lithuania.

The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure that any state monopoly of a commercial character be adjusted, subject to the provisions laid down in Protocol D, so that no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed will exist between nationals of the EFTA States and of Lithuania. These goods shall be procured and marketed in accordance with commercial considerations. 


2. The provisions of this Article shall apply to any body through which the competent authorities of the States Parties to this Agreement, in law or in fact, either directly or indirectly supervise, determine or appreciably influence imports or exports between the States Parties to this Agreement. These provisions shall likewise apply to monopolies delegated by the State to other bodies. 1. 	The States Parties to this Agreement agree: 


(a) 	to hold immediate consultations in the framework of the Joint Committee in case a State Party considers that another State Party has taken measures which are likely to create, or have created, an obstacle to trade, in order to find an appropriate solution; 


(b) 	to discuss in the Joint Committee possibilities to co-operate more closely on matters related to removing obstacles. This co-operation may take place in fields related to technical regulations and standardization as well as testing and certification. 
2. The States Parties to this Agreement commit themselves to notify the technical regulations in accordance with the provisions of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement declare their readiness to foster, in so far as their agricultural policies allow, harmonious development of trade in agricultural products. 


2. In pursuance of this objective each individual EFTA State and Lithuania have concluded a bilateral arrangement providing for measures to facilitate trade in agricultural products. 


3. The States Parties to this Agreement shall apply their regulations in sanitary and phytosanitary matters in a non-discriminatory manner and shall not introduce any new measures that have the effect of unduly obstructing trade. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall refrain from any measure or practice of an internal fiscalnatureestablishing,whetherdirectlyorindirectly,discriminationbetweentheproductsoriginating in an EFTA State and like products originating in Lithuania. 


2. Exporters may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on products exported to the territory of one of the States Parties to this Agreement. 1. Payments relating to trade between an EFTA State and Lithuania and the transfer of such payments to the territory of the State Party to this Agreement where the creditor resides, shall be free from any restrictions. Payments between the Parties shall be effected in freely convertible currencies, unless otherwise agreed by individual companies in individual cases. 


2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall refrain from any currency exchange or administrative restrictions on the grant, repayment or acceptance of short and medium-term credits covering commercial transactions in which a resident participates. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement consider the effective liberalization of their respective public procurement markets on the basis of non-discrimination and reciprocity, in particular on the basis of the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) at Annex IV to the Agreement Establishing the WTO, as an integral objective of this Agreement. 


2. To this effect, the Parties shall, within one year after the entry into force of this Agreement, elaborate rules within the framework of the Joint Committee with a view to ensure such a liberalization. 


3. The States Parties to this Agreement concerned shall endeavour to accede to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall grant and ensure adequate, effective and nondiscriminatory protection of intellectual property rights, including measures for the enforcement of such rights against infringement thereof, counterfeiting and piracy. Particular obligations of the States Parties to this Agreement are contained in Annex V. 


2. In accordance with the substantive provisions of the TRIPS Agreement, in particular gs 4 and 5 thereof, the States Parties to this Agreement shall not grant treatment less favourable to nationals of each other than that accorded to nationals of any other State. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 
(d) of the TRIPS Agreement, any advantage, favour, privilege or immunity deriving from international agreements in force for a State Party to this Agreement at the entry into force of this Agreement and notified to the other States Parties at the latest six months after the entry into force of this Agreement, shall be exempted from this obligation, provided that it does not constitute an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination of nationals of the other States Parties. 


3. Two or more States Parties to this Agreement may conclude further agreements exceeding the requirements of this Agreement, provided that such agreements shall be open to all other States Parties to this Agreement on terms equivalent to those under the agreements and that they shall be ready to enter into good faith negotiations to this end. 


4. The States Parties to this Agreement agree, upon request of an EFTA State or Lithuania, to review the provisions on the protection of intellectual property rights contained in the present Article and in Annex V, with a view to further improve levels of protection and to avoid or remedy trade distortions caused by actual levels of protection of intellectual property rights. 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between an EFTA State and Lithuania: 


(a) 	all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their objective or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition; 


(b) 	abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the States Parties to this Agreement as a whole or in a substantial part thereof. 

2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to the activities of public undertakings, and undertakings for which the States Parties to this Agreement grant special or exclusive rights, in so far as the application of these provisions does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular public tasks assigned to them. 


3. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is incompatible with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). 1. Any aid granted by a State Party to this Agreement or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it may affect trade between an EFTA State and Lithuania, be incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement. 


2. Any practices contrary to paragraph 1 should be assessed on the basis of the criteria set out in Annex VI. 


3. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure transparency of state aid measures by exchanging information as provided in Annex VII. 


4. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is incompatible with the provisions of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). If an EFTA State finds that dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 is taking place in trade with Lithuania, or if Lithuania finds that dumping within this meaning is taking place in trade with an EFTA State, the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and with the procedure laid down in Article 25 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). Where any product is being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause: 


(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products in the territory of the importing State Party to this Agreement, or 


(b) 	serious disturbances in any related sector of the economy or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, 
the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 25 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). 1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the provisions of Article 4 (Customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect) may be taken by Lithuania in the form of increased customs duties. 


2. These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where these difficulties produce important social problems. 


3. After the introduction of these measures, the total ad valorem customs duties applicable in Lithuania to products originating in the EFTA States may not exceed 25% and shall maintain an element of preference for products originating in the EFTA States. The total value of imports of the products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 15% of total imports of industrial products from the EFTA States as defined in Article 2 (a) during the last year for which statistics are available. 


4. These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding three years unless a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee. They shall cease to apply at the latest by 31 December 2000 and no such measures can be introduced in respect of a product if more than three years have elapsed since the entry into force of this Agreement or since the elimination of all duties and quantitative restrictions or charges or measures having an equivalent effect concerning that product, whichever is later. 


5. Lithuania shall inform the Joint Committee of any exceptional measures it intends to take and, at the request of the EFTA States, consultations shall be held in the Joint Committee on such measures and the sectors to which they apply before they are applied. When taking such measures Lithuania shall provide the Joint Committee with a schedule for the elimination of the customs duties introduced under this Article. This schedule shall provide for a phasing out of these duties at equal annual rates starting at the latest two years after their introduction. The Joint Committee may decide on a different schedule. Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 7 (Customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect) and 8 (Quantitative restrictions on imports or exports and measures having equivalent effect) leads to: 


(a) 	re-export towards a third country against which the exporting State Party to this Agreement maintains for the product concerned quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect; or 


(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to the exporting State Party to this Agreement; 
and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting State Party, that State Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). The measures shall be non-discriminatory and be eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance of payments purposes. 


2. Where an EFTA State or Lithuania is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the EFTA State or Lithuania, as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the Understanding on the Balance-of-Payments Provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, adopt trade restrictive measures, which shall be of limited duration and non-discriminatory, and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. Preference shall be given to price-based measures which shall be progressively relaxed as balance of payments conditions improve and eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. The EFTA State or Lithuania, as the case may be, shall inform the other States Parties to this Agreement and the Joint Committee forthwith, if possible, prior to their introduction and shall provide a time schedule for their removal. The Joint Committee shall, upon the request of any other State Party, examine the need for maintaining the measures taken. 


3. No restrictive measures shall apply to transfers related to investments and in particular to the repatriation of amounts invested or reinvested and of any kind of revenues stemming therefrom. 1. Disputes between States Parties to this Agreement, relating to the interpretation of rights and obligations of the States Parties to this Agreement, which have not been settled through consultation or in the Joint Committee within six months, may be referred to arbitration by any State party to the dispute by means of a written notification addressed to the other State party to the dispute. A copy of this notification shall be communicated to all States Parties to this Agreement. 


2. The constitution and functioning of the arbitral tribunal is governed by Annex VIII. 1. Before initiating the procedure for the application of safeguard measures set out in the following paragraphs of the present Article, the States Parties to this Agreement shall endeavour to solve any differences between them through direct consultations, and inform the other States Parties to this Agreement thereof. 


2. Without prejudice to paragraph 6 of the present Article, a State Party which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the other States Parties and the Joint Committee thereof and supply all relevant information. Consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution. 


3. 	(a) As regards Articles 17 (Rules of competition concerning undertakings) and 18 (State aid), the States Parties concerned shall give to the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to. If the State Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement after consultations, or after thirty days following referral for such consultations, the State Party concerned may adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from the practice in question. 


(b) 	As regards Articles 19 (Dumping), 20 (Emergency action on imports of particular products) and 22 (Re-export and serious shortage), the Joint Committee shall examine the case or the situation and may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the State Party concerned. In the absence of such a decision within thirty days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the State Party concerned may adopt the measures necessary in order to remedy the situation. 


(c) 	As regards Article 31 (Fulfilment of obligations), the State Party concerned shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a commonly acceptable solution. If the Joint Committee fails to reach such a solution or if a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures. 

4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the States Parties to this Agreement and to the Joint Committee. They shall be restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their application and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice or the difficulty in question. Priority shall be given to such measures that will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. The measures taken by Lithuania against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect the trade with that State. The measures taken against an action or omission of Lithuania may be only taken by that or those EFTA States the trade of which is affected by the said action or omission. 


5. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, substitution or abolition, when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 


6. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the State Party concerned may, in the cases of Articles 19 (Dumping), 20 (Emergency action on imports of particular products) and 22 (Re-export and serious shortage) and in cases of state aid having a direct and immediate incidence on trade between the States Parties, apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation. The measures shall be notified without delay and consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place as soon as possible within the Joint Committee. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a State Party to this Agreement from taking any measures which it considers necessary: 


(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; 


(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the implementation of international obligations or national policies 


(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes, and to such traffic in other goods, materials and services as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; or 


(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and chemical weapons, nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; or 
(iii) 	taken in time of war or other serious international tension. 1. The implementation of this Agreement shall be supervised and administered by a Joint Committee which shall simultaneously act under the Declaration signed in Geneva in December 1991. 


2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of this Agreement, the States Parties to this Agreement shall exchange information and, at the request of any State Party to this Agreement, shall hold consultations within the Joint Committee. The Joint Committee shall keep under review the possibility of further removal of the obstacles to trade between the EFTA States and Lithuania. 


3. The Joint Committee may take decisions in the cases provided for in this Agreement. On other matters the Joint Committee may make recommendations. 1. For the proper implementation of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall meet whenever necessary but normally once a year. Each State Party to this Agreement may request that a meeting be held. 


2. 	The Joint Committee shall act by common agreement. 


3. If a representative in the Joint Committee of a State Party to this Agreement has accepted a decision, subject to the fulfilment of constitutional requirements, the decision shall enter into force, if no later date is contained therein, on the date the lifting of the reservation is notified. 


4. For the purpose of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure which shall, inter alia, contain provisions for convening meetings and for the designation of the Chairman and his/her term of office. 


5. The Joint Committee may decide to set up such sub-committees and working parties as it considers necessary to assist it in accomplishing its tasks. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement undertake to examine, in light of any relevant factor, the possibility of further developing and deepening the co-operation under this Agreement and to extend it to areas not covered therein. The States Parties to this Agreement may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this possibility and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with a view to opening up negotiations. 


2. Agreementsresultingfromtheprocedurereferredtoinparagraph1willbesubjecttoratification or approval by the States Parties to this Agreement in accordance with their own procedures. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement recognize the growing importance of certain areas, such as services and investments. In their efforts to gradually develop and broaden their co-operation, in particular in the context of European integration, they will co-operate with the aim of achieving a gradual liberalization and mutual opening of markets for investments and trade in services, taking into account the results of the Uruguay Round as well as any relevant work under the auspices of the WTO. They will endeavour to accord to each others' operators treatment no less favourable than that accorded to other foreign operators in their territories on condition that a balance of rights and obligations as well as a balance of operating conditions exist between the States Parties to this Agreement.

PREAMBLE 

The Republic of Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation (hereinafter called the EFTA States) 

and 

the Republic of Latvia (hereinafter called Latvia), 

Recalling their intention to participate actively in the process of economic integration in Europe and expressing their preparedness to co-operate in seeking ways and means to strengthen this process, 

Considering the importance of the links existing between the EFTA States and Latvia, in particular the Declaration signed in Geneva in December 1991, and recognizing the common wish to strengthen these links, thus establishing close and lasting relations, 

Recalling their firm commitment to the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Charter of Paris for a new Europe, and in particular the principles contained in the final document of the CSCE Bonn Conference on Economic Co-operation in Europe, 

Reaffirming their commitment to pluralistic democracy based on the rule of law, human rights, including rights of persons belonging to minorities, and fundamental freedoms, and recalling their membership in the Council of Europe, 

Desiring to create favourable conditions for the development and diversification of trade between them and for the promotion of commercial and economic co-operation in areas of common interest on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, most-favoured-nation treatment and international law, 

Resolved to contribute to the strengthening of the multilateral trading system and to develop their relations in the field of trade in accordance with the principles of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), Latvia having the objective to become a Member of WTO, 

Considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the States Parties to this Agreement from their obligations under other international agreements, especially WTO, 

Determined to implement this Free Trade Agreement with the objective to preserve and protect the environment and to ensure an optimal use of natural resources in accordance with the principle of sustainable growth, 

Firmly convinced that this Free Trade Agreement will foster the creation of an enlarged and harmonious free trade area within Europe, thus constituting an important contribution to European integration, 

Declaring their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant factor, the possibility of developing and deepening their economic relations in order to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement, 

HAVE DECIDED, in pursuit of the above, to conclude the following Agreement (hereinafter called this Agreement): 1. The EFTA States and Latvia shall establish a free trade area in accordance with the provisions of the present Agreement. 


2. The objectives of this Agreement, which is based on trade relations between market economies and on the respect of democratic principles and human rights, are: 


(a) 	to promote, through the expansion of reciprocal trade, the harmonious development of the economic relations between the EFTA States and Latvia and thus to foster in the EFTA States and in Latvia the advance of economic activity, the improvement of living and employment conditions, and increased productivity and financial stability; 


(b) 	to provide fair conditions of competition for trade between the States Parties to this Agreement; 


(c) 	to contribute in this way, by the removal of barriers to trade, to European economic integration and to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade. This Agreement shall apply: 


(a) 	to products falling within Chapters 25 to 97 of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, excluding the products listed in Annex I; 


(b) 	to products specified in Protocol A, with due regard to the arrangements provided for in that Protocol; 


(c) 	to fish and other marine products as provided for in Annex II; originating in an EFTA State or Latvia. 1. 	Protocol B lays down the rules of origin and methods of administrative co-operation. 


2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall take appropriate measures, including regular reviews by the Joint Committee and arrangements for administrative co-operation, to ensure that the provisions of Articles 4 (Customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect), 5 (Customs duties of a fiscal nature), 6 (Customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect), 7 (Quantitative restrictions on imports or exports and measures having equivalent effect), 12 (Internal taxation) and 21 (Re-export and serious shortage) of this Agreement and Protocol B are effectively and harmoniously applied, and to reduce, as far as possible, the formalities imposed on trade, and to achieve mutually satisfactory solutions to any difficulties arising from the operation of those provisions. 


3. A first review referred to in paragraph 2 will take place within one year after the entry into force of this Agreement. Subsequent reviews shall take place every second year. On the basis of these reviews, the States Parties to this Agreement shall decide on the appropriate measures to be taken. 1. No new customs duty on imports or charge having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the EFTA States and Latvia.

2. The EFTA States shall abolish on the date of entry into force of this Agreement quantitative restrictions on imports or exports and measures having equivalent effect, except as provided for in Annex IV.

This Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants and the environment; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; the protection of intellectual property; rules relating to gold or silver; or the conservation of exhaustible natural resources, if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the States Parties to this Agreement. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure that any state monopoly of a commercial character be adjusted, subject to the provisions laid down in Protocol D, so that no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed will exist between nationals of the EFTA States and of Latvia. These goods shall be procured and marketed in accordance with commercial considerations. 


2. The provisions of this Article shall apply to any body through which the competent authorities of the States Parties to this Agreement, in law or in fact, either directly or indirectly supervise, determine or appreciably influence imports or exports between the States Parties to this Agreement. These provisions shall likewise apply to monopolies delegated by the State to other bodies. 1. 	The States Parties to this Agreement agree: 


(a) 	to hold immediate consultations in the framework of the Joint Committee in case a State Party considers that another State Party has taken measures which are likely to create, or have created, an obstacle to trade, in order to find an appropriate solution; 


(b) 	to discuss in the Joint Committee possibilities to co-operate more closely on matters related to removing obstacles. This co-operation may take place in fields related to technical regulations and standardization as well as testing and certification. 
2. The States Parties to this Agreement commit themselves to notify the technical regulations in accordance with the provisions of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement declare their readiness to foster, in so far as their agricultural policies allow, harmonious development of trade in agricultural products. 


2. In pursuance of this objective each individual EFTA State and Latvia have concluded a bilateral arrangement providing for measures to facilitate trade in agricultural products. 


3. The States Parties to this Agreement shall apply their regulations in sanitary and phytosanitary matters in a non-discriminatory fashion and shall not introduce any new measures that have the effect of unduly obstructing trade. 1.

2. To this effect, the Parties shall, within one year after the entry into force of this Agreement, elaborate rules within the framework of the Joint Committee with a view to ensure such a liberalization. 


3. The States Parties to this Agreement concerned shall endeavour to accede to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall grant and ensure adequate, effective and nondiscriminatory protection of intellectual property rights, including measures for the enforcement of such rights against infringement thereof, counterfeiting and piracy. Particular obligations of the States Parties to this Agreement are contained in Annex V. 


2. In accordance with the substantive provisions of the TRIPS Agreement, in particular Articles 4 and 5 thereof, the States Parties to this Agreement shall not grant treatment less favourable to nationals of each other than that accorded to nationals of any other State. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 
(d) of the TRIPS Agreement, any advantage, favour, privilege or immunity deriving from international agreements in force for a State Party to this Agreement at the entry into force of this Agreement and notified to the other States Parties at the latest six months after the entry into force of this Agreement, shall be exempted from this obligation, provided that it does not constitute an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination of nationals of the other States Parties. 


3. Two or more States Parties to this Agreement may conclude further agreements exceeding the requirements of this Agreement, provided that such agreements shall be open to all other States Parties to this Agreement on terms equivalent to those under the agreements and that they shall be ready to enter into good faith negotiations to this end. 


4. The States Parties to this Agreement agree, upon request of an EFTA State or Latvia, to review the provisions on the protection of intellectual property rights contained in the present Article and in Annex V, with a view to further improve levels of protection and to avoid or remedy trade distortions caused by actual levels of protection of intellectual property rights. 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between an EFTA State and Latvia: 


(a) 	all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition; 


(b) 	abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the States Parties to this Agreement as a whole or in a substantial part thereof. 

2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to the activities of public undertakings, and undertakings for which the States Parties to this Agreement grant special or exclusive rights, in so far as the application of these provisions does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular public tasks assigned to them. 


3. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is incompatible with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). 1. Any aid granted by a State Party to this Agreement or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it may affect trade between an EFTA State and Latvia, be incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement. 


2. Any practices contrary to paragraph 1 should be assessed on the basis of the criteria set out in Annex VI. 


3. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure transparency of state aid measures by exchanging information as provided in Annex VII. 


4. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is incompatible with the provisions of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). If an EFTA State finds that dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 is taking place in trade with Latvia, or if Latvia finds that dumping within this meaning is taking place in trade with an EFTA State, the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and with the procedure laid down in Article 24 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). Where any product is being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause: 


(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products in the territory of the importing State Party to this Agreement, or 


(b) 	serious disturbances in any related sector of the economy or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, 
the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). 1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the provisions of Article 4 (Customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect) may be taken by Latvia in the form of increased customs duties. 


2. These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where these difficulties produce important social problems. 


3. Aftertheintroductionofthesemeasures,thetotaladvaloremcustomsdutiesapplicableinLatvia to products originating in the EFTA States may not exceed 25% and shall maintain an element of preference for products originating in the EFTA States. They may not exceed customs duties levied on imports to Latvia of similar goods from any other country. The total value of imports of the products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 15% of total imports of industrial products from the EFTA States as defined in Article 2(a) during the last year for which statistics are available. 


4. These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding two years unless a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee. They shall cease to apply at the latest four years after the entry into force of this Agreement and no such measures can be introduced in respect of a product if more than three years have elapsed since the entry into force of this Agreement. 


5. Latvia shall inform the Joint Committee of any exceptional measures it intends to take and, at the request of the EFTA States, consultations shall be held in the Joint Committee on such measures and the sectors to which they apply before they are applied. When taking such measures Latvia shall provide the Joint Committee with a schedule for the elimination of the customs duties introduced under this Article. This schedule shall provide for a phasing out of these duties at equal annual rates starting at the latest two years after their introduction. The Joint Committee may decide on a different schedule. Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 6 (Customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect) and 7 (Quantitative restrictions on imports or exports and measures having equivalent effect) leads to: 


(a) 	re-export towards a third country against which the exporting State Party to this Agreement maintains for the product concerned quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect; or 


(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to the exporting State Party to this Agreement; 
and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting State Party, that State Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). The measures shall be non-discriminatory and be eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance of payments purposes. 


2. Where an EFTA State or Latvia is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the EFTA State or Latvia, as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the Understanding on the Balance-of-Payments Provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, adopt trade 
restrictive measures, which shall be of limited duration and non-discriminatory, and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. Preference shall be given to price-based measureswhichshallbeprogressively relaxedasbalanceof paymentsconditionsimproveand eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. The EFTA State or Latvia, as the case may be, shall inform the other States Parties to this Agreement and the Joint Committee forthwith, if possible, prior to their introduction and shall provide a time schedule for their removal. The Joint Committee shall, upon the request of any other State Party, examine the need for maintaining the measures taken. 1. Disputes between States Parties to this Agreement, relating to the interpretation of rights and obligations of the States Parties to this Agreement, which have not been settled through consultation or in the Joint Committee within six months, may be referred to arbitration by any State party to the dispute by means of a written notification addressed to the other State party to the dispute. A copy of this notification shall be communicated to all States Parties to this Agreement. 


2. 	The constitution and functioning of the arbitral tribunal is governed by Annex VIII. 1. Before initiating the procedure for the application of safeguard measures set out in the following paragraphs of the present Article, the States Parties to this Agreement shall endeavour to solve any differences between them through direct consultations, and inform the other States Parties to this Agreement thereof. 


2. Without prejudice to paragraph 6 of the present Article, a State Party which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the other States Parties and the Joint Committee thereof and supply all relevant information. Consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution. 


3. 	(a) As regards Articles 16 (Rules of competition concerning undertakings) and 17 (State aid), the States Parties concerned shall give to the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to. If the State Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement after consultations, or after thirty days following referral for such consultations, the State Party concerned may adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from the practice in question. 


(b) 	As regards Articles 18 (Dumping), 19 (Emergency action on imports of particular products) and 21 (Re-export and serious shortage), the Joint Committee shall examine the case or the situation and may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the State Party concerned. In the absence of such a decision within thirty days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the State Party concerned may adopt the measures necessary in order to remedy the situation. 


(c) 	As regards Article 30 (Fulfilment of obligations), the State Party concerned shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a commonly acceptable solution. If the Joint Committee fails to reach such a solution or if a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures. 

4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the States Parties to this Agreement and to the Joint Committee. They shall be restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their application and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice or the difficulty in question. Priority shall be given to such measures that will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. The measures taken by Latvia against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect the trade with that State. The measures taken against an action or omission of Latvia may be only taken by that or those EFTA States the trade of which is affected by the said action or omission. 


5. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, substitution or abolition, when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 


6. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the State Party concerned may, in the cases of Articles 18 (Dumping), 19 (Emergency action on imports of particular products) and 21 (Re-export and serious shortage) and in cases of state aid having a direct and immediate incidence on trade between the States Parties, apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation. The measures shall be notified without delay and consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place as soon as possible within the Joint Committee. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a State Party to this Agreement from taking any measures which it considers necessary: 


(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; 


(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the implementation of international obligations or national policies 


(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes, and to such traffic in other goods, materials and services as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; or 


(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and chemical weapons, nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; or 
(iii) 	taken in time of war or other serious international tension. 1. The implementation of this Agreement shall be supervised and administered by a Joint Committee which shall simultaneously act under the Declaration signed in Geneva in December 1991. 


2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of this Agreement, the States Parties to this Agreement shall exchange information and, at the request of any State Party to this Agreement, shall hold consultations within the Joint Committee. The Joint Committee shall keep under review the possibility of further removal of the obstacles to trade between the EFTA States and Latvia. 


3. The Joint Committee may take decisions in the cases provided for in this Agreement. On other matters the Joint Committee may make recommendations. 1. For the proper implementation of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall meet whenever necessary but normally once a year. Each State Party to this Agreement may request that a meeting be held. 


2. The Joint Committee shall act by common agreement. 


3. If a representative in the Joint Committee of a State Party to this Agreement has accepted a decision subject to the fulfilment of constitutional requirements, the decision shall enter into force, if no later date is contained therein, on the date the lifting of the reservation is notified. 


4. For the purpose of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure which shall, inter alia, contain provisions for convening meetings and for the designation of the Chairman and his/her term of office. 


5. The Joint Committee may decide to set up such sub-committees and working parties as it considers necessary to assist it in accomplishing its tasks. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement undertake to examine, in light of any relevant factor, the possibility of further developing and deepening the co-operation under this Agreement and to extend it to areas not covered therein. The States Parties to this Agreement may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this possibility and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with a view to opening up negotiations. 


2. Agreementsresultingfromtheprocedurereferredtoinparagraph1willbesubjecttoratification or approval by the States Parties to this Agreement in accordance with their own procedures. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement recognize the growing importance of certain areas, such as services and investments. In their efforts to gradually develop and broaden their co-operation, in particular in the context of European integration, they will co-operate with the aim of achieving a gradual liberalization and mutual opening of markets for investments and trade in services, taking into account the results of the Uruguay Round as well as any relevant work under the auspices of the WTO. They will endeavour to accord to each others' operators treatment no less favourable than that accorded to other foreign operators in their territories on condition that a balance of rights and obligations as well as a balance of operating conditions exist between the individual States Parties to this Agreement. 


2. The EFTA States and Latvia will discuss this co-operation in the Joint Committee with the aim of developing and deepening their relations under this Agreement. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall take all necessary measures to ensure the achievement of the objectives of this Agreement and the fulfilment of their obligations under this Agreement.

FREE-TRADE TREATY BETWEEN THE REPUBLICS OF NICARAGUA 
AND EL SALVADOR 


The Government of the Republic of Nicaragua and the Government of the 
Republic of El Salvador, desirous of strengthening the traditional bonds of 
fraternal friendship which exist between the two countries and of developing 
still further and to their mutual advantage their trade relations, have 
decided to conclude a free-trade treaty and have, for this purpose, appointed 
as their respective plenipotentiaries: 


For His Excellency the President of the Republic of Nicaragua, 


The Nicaraguan Minister of Foreign Affairs; 


For His Excellency the President of the Republic of El Salvador, 


The Minister of Foreign Affairs of El Salvador; 


Who, after having exchanged their respective credentials and found them in 
order, have agreed upon the following provisions. The Contracting Parties hereby declare their intention of establishing 
at some future time a free-trade area by abolishing the customs duties and 
other trade restrictions applicable to the majority of products originating 
in the two countries. 


Provisionally, and pending the uniformization of the customs tariffs 
between the two countries, the signatories hereby decide to adopt a system
of commodity lists to which the benefits of this Treaty shall immediately
apply. The goods originating in the signatory countries, enumerated in the 
attached schedule constituting Annex A to this Treaty (on condition that these 
consist of natural products of these countries or articles manufactured 
mainly from raw materials of either of them). shall be exempt, in both 


countries, fran consular fees, and all taxes, charges, surtaxes, fees or 
dues of a fiscal or local character, due or levied in connection with imports, 
exports, or the transfer from one country to the other of funds intended 
for the payment of imports or exports. 


It is stipulated, however, that the exemptions contemplated in the 


preceding paragraph shall not apply to anchorage dues, charges for lighterage,


handling or warehousing goods, or to the fees imposed by other port or 


transport services, which are legally due in the territories of the signatory 


States. It is also agreed that if one of the goods enumerated in the 


annexed schedule is liable to internal taxes or duties on the manufacture,


sale, or consumption of goods in one of the signatory countries, that 


country shall be entitled to levy equivalent taxes or duties on similar 


commodities imported from the other country. Ordinary goods originating from the territories of the Contracting 


Parties shall, if they figure in the schedule annexed to this Treaty, be 


exempt from any measure of quantitative control in either of the States in 


question, without prejudice, however, to compliance with the formalities 
applicable to foreign trade in each of these territories or to any measures 
of control applied for hygiene or police reasons. 


Notwithstanding the above, goods in respect of which the Contracting 
Parties have expressly reserved their right to adopt measures of total or 
partial control on importation or exportation, shall be excepted from this 
provision. Such commodities are indicated in the annexed list by an 
asterisk followed by an explanatory note specifying the scope of the 
measures in question. 


In the event of one of the Contracting Parties proposing to adopt 
measures for the quantitative control of imports or exports, as specified 
in the preceding paragraph, the said State shall proceed in such a way as 
to reduce to a minimum the unfavourable consequences which such measures 
might have on the economy of the other State, and shall authorize the normal 
completion of current transactions which have been duly verified, For this 
purpose, the said State shall at the appropriate time, furnish the other 
State with detailed particulars on this matters so as to enable the two 
Governments to coordinate their respective action. 


The putting into force, modification or cancellation of the measures 
of quantitative control provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article, shall 
immediately be communicated to the other State by a note. The schedule which figures in Annex A to this Treaty may be lengthened, 
shortened, 


or modified by mutual agreement between the two Governments, by 


an exchange of notes, provided that the relevant constitutional provisions 


of the two respective States have previously been complied with. The two Contracting Parties, with the firm intention of establishing a 
customs union between their respective territories, mutually agree that any 
addition to the annexed schedule shall be preceded, whenever this is possible, 
by a comparison of the taxes and duties levied by each of the Contracting 
Parties on the importation of similar goods from countries other than those 
which formerly constituted the Federation of Central America. 


In the case of goods in the manufacture or packing of which raw materials 
of foreign origin are used, the above-mentioned comparison of customs duties 
shall also apply to such raw materials or packing. In order to ensure that the goods figuring in the annexed schedule 


shall enjoy the advantages specified in this Treaty, they must be accompanied


by a customs declaration, signed by the exporter and containing a certificate 


of origin, and which will be subject to the visa and approval of the customs 


authorities of both countries, in accordance with the provisions of Annex B 


of this Treaty. The goods which do not figure in the annexed schedule, but which 
originate in either of the Signatory States, shall enjoy, unconditionally


most-favoured-nation treatment within the territory of the other State as 
regards everything which concerns customs and subsidiary duties the methods 
for recoveringsuch duties, and the rules, formalities and charges connected 
with customs operations, as well as all or any measures for the control of 
means of payment and for regulating the international transfer of funds. 


It shall, nevertheless, be agreed that most-favoured-nation treatment, 
as provided in the preceding paragraph, shall not apply to the advantages
granted by one of the Parties,' in virtue of free-trade treaties, to one or 


more of the states formerly belonging to the Central American Federation. Goods coming from the territory of any of the signatory States, or 


which have been despatched to such territory shall enjoy the advantages of 


free transit within the territory of the other State, subject to the 


administrative provisions relating to fiscal protection, or public security, 


in force within the territory through which they are in transit. No signatory State shall, directly or indirectly, grant export subsidies 
in favour of goods despatched to the territory of the other State, or institute 


a regime rendering it possible to sell a given commodity, for the purpose of 
export to another country, at a price lower than that fixed for the sale 
of that commodity in the home market, with due allowance for the existing
differences in selling conditions and the charges to which it is liable, or 
any other factors which enter into a comparison of prices. 


Any practice prevailing in either of the Signatory States which 
consists in fixing prices or enforcing price discrimination, and which 
would take the form of fixing the selling price of a given commodity in 
the other State at rates lower than those normally resulting from the free 
play of the supply and demand of that commodity in the exporting country,
shall be deemed an indirect export subsidy.. 


Notwithstanding the above,exemptions from taxation granted by either 
of the signatory countries for the purpose of developing production shall 
not be deemed subsidies. With regard to the reprehensible practice of dumping, in conflict with 


the objects of this Treaty, each of the signatory States shall avoid, with 


the aid of the legal machinery at its disposal, from exporting the commodi

ties 	of the said State to the territory of the other State at prices below 


their 	normal value, in such a way as to cause prejudice or to threaten to 


cause 	prejudice to the interests of any industry established within the 


territory of the other State, or which would delay the creation of a national 


industry, Any commodity shall be deemed to have been exported at a price 


below 	the normal value if the price of that commodity: 



(a) 	is lower than the comparable price, under normal trade conditions, 
of a similar commodity intended for consumption in the home market 
of the exporting country, or 



(b) 	in default of such a price in the home market, is lower than: 

(i) 	the highest comparable price, for export to a third country, 


of a 	similar commodity, under normal trade conditions, or, 


(ii) 	the cost of producing such a commodity in the country of 
origin, plus a reasonable percentage to cover selling costs 
and profits. 


In each case, account shall be taken of the differences in conditions 
of sale and taxation, including any other differences which might affect 
the comparative price, With a view to eliminating the effects of any direct or indirect export 
subsidies which might be granted in either of the signatory countries, or 


the effects of the above mentioned reprehensible practice of dumping, the 
State which is thereby prejudiced shall be entitled to impose countervailing 
customs duties, up to the limit of the amount required to lower the 
difference or the artificial price margin occasioned by the subsidies or 
the above-mentioned practices, provided that the other contracting State 
shall previously have been notified. So long as either of the Contracting Parties shall continue to apply 
measures for the control of the international transfer of funds, the 
signatory States hereby undertake to establish a special system of payments,
which will function in conformity with the provisions of Annex C of this 
Treaty. The provisions in question may be altered by mutual agreement 
between the two governments by means of an exchange of notes. Merchant ships of the two signatory States' shall be treated, in the 
ports of the other State open to international trade and while entering, 
remaining in or leaving harbour in the same way and under the same conditions 
as the ships of the latter State, and shall be given the benefit of treatment 
as favourable as that accorded to vessels of any other country with regard 
not only to dues and charges of any kind, but also it respect of the 
formalities and requirements of any descriptions which vessels, including 
their passengers, crews, and cargo are subject. Commercia aircraft of either of the Contracting States shall be treated 


in the airports of the other State open to international traffic in the same 
way as aircraft of the latter country, and shall receive as favourable 
treatment as. that accorded to the aircraft of any other country. This shall 
also apply to the passengers, crew and cargo. Land vehicles registered in either of the Contracting States shall be 
entitled, in the territory of the other State, to the same treatment as 
vehicles registered in the latter. The provisions of the three preceding Articles shall be applied without 
prejudice to the observance of the formalities relating to the registration 
and control which are applied in all countries with the entry, stay, or 
taparture of ships, aircraft and land vehicles for security, police, or 
sanitary reasons,or for the protection of public or fiscal interests. Each of the Contracting States shall accord equitable treatment to the 
capital investments of persons or companies of nationals of the other States 
and shall,therefore, refrain from the adoption of discriminatory measures 
liable to cause prejudice to rights lawfully acquired by such persons or 
companies. 


The capital investments of the nationals of either of the Contracting 
States shall, furthermore, be entitled, in the territory at the other State, 


to most-favoured-nation treatment with everything concerning the right to 
organize agricultural, industrial, commercial, mining or financial under

takings, or to participate in such undertakings; the administration or 
management of such undertakings; the international transfer of funds for 
investments, or remitting profits, dividends or amortizations derived from 


these undertakings. The governments of each of the Contracting Parties shall, as soon as 
possible, set up a National admission for the purpose of examining the 


questions relating to this Treaty, with the following functions: 


(a) 	to analyze statistical and other information concerning trade 
between the two signatory countries; 


(b) to examine any special cases submitted to it by its own government 


which concern economic relations between the two countries, and 
giving its opinion on such questions; 


(c) 	to undertake a study of and to propose to its own government, or 
to the Mixed Commission hereinafter referred to, any increases 
reductions, or modifications which it might be expedient to embody 
in the annexed list of good,,.' and also to recommend any 
measures conducive to the more effective realization of the objects 
of this Treaty. The governments of the two States shall appoint delegations, comprising 
one or more representatives of their respective National Commissions, to 
constitute a Mixed Trade Commission, which shall meet every six months and 
shall have the following functions: 



(a) 	to compare and analyse the statistics and other relevant particulars 
relating to trade between the two States; 



(b) 	to examine and propose any measures which the Commission considers 
expedient to adopt for the purpose of solving the problems raised by 
the application of this Treaty; 



(c) 	to examine and recommend any increases, reductions or modifications 
in the annexed schedule, and also any useful provisions intended 
to encourage the o',rnomic integration of the two countries and the 

unification of their customs tariffs, with a view to arriving 
progressively at the Customs Union which it is the intention of 
both governments to establish, The statistical services of the two countries shall collect and analyze
the data concerning import and export operations effected in virtue ofthis 
Treaty, in accordance with the rules established by the respective authorities 
of the two signatory States, in agreement with the Mixed Commission and in 
accordance with the provisions of Annex B to this Treaty. The signatory States hereby decide fraternally to solve, in accordance with 
the spirit of this Treaty, any difference which may arise in connection with 
the interpretation of the application of any of its clauses whatsoever. In 
the event of their being unable to come to an agreement, the dispute shall be 
submitted to arbitration. If either of the Contracting Parties shall conclude a treaty of commerce 
with another country which had formerly been a member of the Central American 
Federation and if such treaty contemplates free trade for all of the greater 
part of the goods originating inthe territories of one of the parties to this 
Treaty, the governments signatory to this Treaty shall consult together with 
a view to adapting their trade relations, if necessary, to the altered 
situation which has arisen, or to establishing in Central America a more 
extensive free-trade area than is contemplated in this Treaty. This Treaty shall remain valid for a period of two years as from the date 
of the exchange of ratifications, and shall continue in force indefinitely as 
long as one of the parties has not denounced it, subject to at least six 
months previous notice. 


Notwithstanding the above, however, so long as either of the signatory 
States shall retain measures for the control of the international transfer of 
funds, either of the parties shall be entitled to denounce this Treaty if the 
special payment regime, established in accordance with Article XII, should 
lapse and if the parties are unable to agree on its renewal, or on the 
institution of another system satisfactory to both parties. In that case, 
denunciation shall take effect at the expiration of the period fixed by the 
State responsible for the denunciation, the period in question being not less 
than three months. This Treaty shall be submitted by the signatory governments to ratification, as provided by their constitutions, and the exchange of ratifications 
shall take place, as soon as possible, either at Managua or at San Salvador. In confirmation of which the plenipotentiaries of the respective 
governments have signed this Treaty in two original and authentic copies 
and have affixed their seal in the city of Managua, the 1951.

co-operation in areas of common interest on the basis of equality, mutual

Economic Co-operation in Europe, 


Recalling the traditional trade and economic links between Finland and

development,

when payments in freely convertible currencies are not feasible. The Annex to this Protocol lays down the rules of origin. The Parties undertake to examine, in light of any relevant factor, the 
possibility of developing and deepening their relations in order to extend 
them to fields not covered by this Protocol, in particular to investment

scientific co-operation. 1. If any increase in imports of a given product originating in the 
territory of one of the Parties occurs in quantities or under conditions as 
to cause, or threaten to cause disruption to the domestic market or

other Party of the disruption and supply the latter with all relevant 
information required for a thorough examination in the Joint Committee. 



3. In the absence of any mutually satisfactory solution in the Joint 
Committee within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Party 
concerned may apply any safeguard measures necessary to remedy the 
situation. 


4. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior 
examination impossible, the Party concerned may apply forthwith the 
precautionary measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.

(b) 	to products specified in Protocol A, with due regard to the arrangements provided for in that Protocol; 


(c) 	to fish and other marine products as provided for in Annex II; 
originating in an EFTA State or Slovenia. 1. Protocol B lays down the rules of origin and methods of administrative co-operation. 


2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall take appropriate measures, including regular reviews by the Joint Committee and arrangements for administrative co-operation, to ensure that the provisions of Articles 4 (Customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect), 5 (Basic duties), 6 (Customs duties of a fiscal nature), 7 (Customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect), 8(Quantitative restrictions on imports or exports and measures having equivalent effect), 13 (Internal taxation) and 22 (Re-export and serious shortage) of the Agreement and Protocol B are effectively and harmoniously applied, and to reduce, as far as possible, the formalities imposed on trade, and to achieve mutually satisfactory solutions to any difficulties arising from the operation of those provisions. 


3. A first review referred to in paragraph 2 will take place before 1 July 1996. Subsequent reviews shall take place at two-yearly intervals.  On the basis of these reviews, the States Parties to this Agreement shall decide on the appropriate measures to be taken. 1. No new customs duty on imports or charge having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the EFTA States and Slovenia. 


2. The EFTA States shall abolish on the date of entry into force of this Agreement all customs duties on imports and any charges having equivalent effect on products originating in Slovenia, except for products specified in Annex III,1 for which customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect shall be progressively abolished in accordance with the provisions laid down in that Annex. 


3. Slovenia shall abolish customs duties on imports and any charges having equivalent effect on products originating in an EFTA State as provided for in Annex IV. 
The content of Annex III was deleted by Joint Committee Decision No. 5 of 1999 (27 May 1999), with effect from 1 July 1999. 1. For each product the basic duty to which the successive reductions set out in this Agreement are to be applied, shall be the Most-Favoured-Nation rate of duty applied on 1 January 1995. 


2. If, after 1 January 1995, any tariff reduction is applied on an erga omnes basis, in particular reductions implemented as a result of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, such reduced duties shall replace the basic duties referred to in paragraph 1 as from the date when such reductions are applied, or from the entry into force of this Agreement if this is later. 


3. The reduced duties calculated in accordance with Article 4 (Customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect) shall be applied rounded to the first decimal place or, in case of specific duties, to the second decimal place. 1. The provisions of Article 4 (Customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect) shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature, except as provided for in Protocol 


2. The States Parties to this Agreement may replace a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty by an internal tax. 
C.1 1. No new customs duty on exports or charge having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the EFTA States and Slovenia. 


2. The EFTA States shall abolish on the date of entry into force of this Agreement all customs duties on exports and any charges having equivalent effect. 


3. Slovenia shall abolish customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect as provided for in Annex V.2 
1 	The content of Protocol C was deleted by Joint Committee Decision No. 7 of 1999 (27 May 1999), with effect from 1 July 1999. 

2 	The content of Annex V was deleted by Joint Committee Decision No. 6 of 1999 (27 May 1999), with effect from 1 July 1999. 1. No new quantitative restriction on imports or exports and measures having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the EFTA States and Slovenia. 


2. The EFTA States and Slovenia shall abolish on the date of entry into force of this Agreement quantitative restrictions on imports or exports and measures having equivalent effect, except as provided for in Annex VI.1 This Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants and the environment; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; the protection of intellectual property; rules relating to gold or silver; or the conservation of exhaustible natural resources, if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption.  Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the States Parties to this Agreement. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure that any state monopoly of a commercial character be adjusted, subject to the provisions laid down in Protocol D, so that no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed will exist between nationals of the EFTA States and of Slovenia. 


2. The provisions of this Article shall apply to any body through which the competent authorities of the States Parties to this Agreement, in law or in fact, either directly or indirectly supervise, determine or appreciably influence imports or exports between the States Parties to this Agreement. These provisions shall likewise apply to monopolies delegated by the State to others. 
The content of Annex VI was deleted by Joint Committee Decision No. 8 of 1999 (27 May 1999), with effect from 1 July 1999. The States Parties to this Agreement may, in the Joint Committee, agree 


(a) 	to hold immediate consultations in case a State Party considers that another State Party has taken measures which are likely to create, or have created, an obstacle to trade; 


(b) 	to discuss possibilities to co-operate more closely on matters related to removing obstacles. This co-operation may take place in fields related to technical regulations and standardization as well as testing and certification. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement declare their readiness to foster, in so far as their agricultural policies allow, harmonious development of trade in agricultural products. 


2. In pursuance of this objective each individual EFTA State and Slovenia have concluded a bilateral arrangement providing for measures to facilitate trade in agricultural products. 


3. The States Parties to this Agreement shall apply their regulations in sanitary and phytosanitary matters in a non-discriminatory fashion and shall not introduce any new measures that have the effect of unduly obstructing trade. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall refrain from any measure or practice of an internal fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or indirectly, discrimination between the products originating in an EFTA State and like products originating in Slovenia. 


2. Products exported to the territory of one of the States Parties to this Agreement may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on them. 1. Payments relating to trade between an EFTA State and Slovenia and the transfer of such payments to the territory of the State Party to this Agreement, where the creditor resides, shall be free from any restrictions. 


2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall refrain from any exchange or administrative restrictions on the grant, repayment or acceptance of short and medium-term credits covering commercial transactions in which a resident participates. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement consider the effective liberalization of their respective public procurement markets as an integral objective of this Agreement, as defined in Article 1 (Objectives). 


2. As of the entry into force of this Agreement, the EFTA States shall grant companies from Slovenia access to contract award procedures on their respective public procurement markets according to the Agreement on Government Procurement of 12 April 1979, as amended by a Protocol of Amendments of 2 February 1987, negotiated under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Slovenia shall, taking into account the restructuring and development process of its economy, gradually ensure that companies from the EFTA States have access to contract award procedures on its public procurement market on the same principles. 


3. As soon as possible after the entry into force of this Agreement, the States Parties to this Agreement shall progressively develop and adjust the rules, conditions and practices governing the participation in public procurement contracts awarded by public authorities and public undertakings, and by private undertakings which have been granted special or exclusive rights, so as to ensure free access and transparency, and that there is no discrimination between potential suppliers from the States Parties to this Agreement. A full balance of rights and obligations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall be established not later than at the end of the transitional period as defined in Article 1 (Objectives), paragraph 1. 


4. The Joint Committee shall agree on the practical modalities for this development including, inter alia, scope, timetable and rules to be applied. 


5. The States Parties to this Agreement concerned shall endeavour to accede to the relevant Agreements negotiated under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade during the Tokyo Round as well as to the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) at Annex IV to the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall grant and ensure adequate, effective and non-discriminatory protection of intellectual property rights, including measures for the enforcement of such rights against infringement thereof, counterfeiting and piracy, in accordance with the provisions of this Article, Annex VII to this Agreement and the international agreements referred to therein. 


2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall accord to each others’ nationals treatment no less favourable than that they accord to their own nationals. Exemptions from this obligation must be in accordance with the substantive provisions of Article 3 of the WTO Agreement of 15 April 1994 on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement). 


3. The States Parties to this Agreement shall grant to each others' nationals treatment no less favourable than that accorded to nationals of any other State. Exemptions from this obligation must be in accordance with the substantive provisions of the TRIPS Agreement, in particular Articles 4 and 5 thereof. 


4. The States Parties to this Agreement agree, upon request of any State Party, to review the provisions on the protection of intellectual property rights contained in the present Article and in Annex VII, with a view to further improving levels of protection and to avoid or remedy trade distortions caused by actual levels of protection of intellectual property rights. 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between an EFTA State and Slovenia: 


(a) 	all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition; 


(b) 	abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the States Parties to this Agreement as a whole or in a substantial part thereof. 
As amended by Protocol (9 October 1996); entered into force between Slovenia and Norway on 1 September 1998. 


2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to the activities of public undertakings, and undertakings for which the States Parties to this Agreement grant special or exclusive rights, in so far as the application of these provisions does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular public tasks assigned to them. 


3. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is incompatible with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). 1. Any aid granted by a State Party to this Agreement or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it may affect trade between an EFTA State and Slovenia, be incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement. 


2. Any practices contrary to paragraph 1 should be assessed on the basis of the criteria set out in Annex VIII. 


3. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure transparency of state aid measures by exchanging information as provided in Annex IX. 


4. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is incompatible with the provisions of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). If an EFTA State finds that dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 is taking place in trade with Slovenia, or if Slovenia finds that dumping within this meaning is taking place in trade with an EFTA State, the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and with the procedure laid down in Article 25 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). 

Article 18 was amended by Joint Committee Decision No. 3 of 2001 (24 April 2001). The Decision will enter into force when the instruments of acceptance have been deposited by all Parties with the Depositary. The current Article 18 will then be replaced. Where any product is being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause: 


(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products in the territory of the importing State Party to this Agreement, or 


(b) 	serious disturbances in any related sector of the economy or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, 
the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 25 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). 1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the provisions of Article 4 (Customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect) may be taken by Slovenia in the form of increased customs duties. 


2. These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where these difficulties produce important social problems. 


3. Customs duties on imports applicable in Slovenia to products originating in the EFTA States introduced by these measures may, after the introduction of these measures, not exceed 25% ad valorem and shall maintain an element of preference for products originating in the EFTA States. They may not exceed customs duties levied on imports to Slovenia of similar goods from any other countries. The total value of imports of the products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 15% of total imports of industrial products from the EFTA States as defined in Article 2 during the last year for which statistics are available. 


4. These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding five years unless a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee. They shall cease to apply at the latest at the expiration of the transitional period as defined in Article 1 (Objectives), paragraph 1. 


5. No such measures can be introduced in respect of a product if more than three years have elapsed since the elimination of all duties and quantitative restrictions or charges or measures having an equivalent effect concerning that product. 


6. Slovenia shall inform the Joint Committee of any exceptional measures it intends to take and, at the request of the EFTA States, consultations shall be held in the Joint Committee on such measures and the sectors to which they apply before they are applied.  When taking such measures Slovenia shall provide the Joint Committee with a schedule for the elimination of the customs duties introduced under this Article. This schedule shall provide for a phasing out of these duties at equal annual rates starting at the latest two years after their introduction. The Joint Committee may decide on a different schedule. Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 7 (Customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect) and 8 (Quantitative restrictions on imports or exports and measures having equivalent effect) leads to: 


(a) 	re-export towards a third country against which the exporting State Party to this Agreement maintains for the product concerned quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect; or 


(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to the exporting State Party to this Agreement; 
and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting State Party, that State Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). The measures shall be non-discriminatory and be eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 1. Where an EFTA State or Slovenia is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the EFTA State or Slovenia, as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, adopt trade restrictive measures, which shall be of limited duration and nondiscriminatory, and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. Preference shall be given to price-based measures which shall be progressively relaxed as balance of payments conditions improve and eliminated when conditions no longer 

justify their maintenance. The EFTA State or Slovenia, as the case may be, shall inform the other States Parties to this Agreement and the Joint Committee forthwith of their introduction and of a time schedule for their removal. 

2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall, nevertheless, endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance of payments purposes. 1. Disputes between States Parties to this Agreement, relating to its interpretation or application, which have not been settled through negotiation or in the Joint Committee within a reasonable period of time, may be referred to arbitration by any State party to the dispute by means of a written notification addressed to the other State party to the dispute. A copy of this notification shall be communicated to all States Parties to this Agreement. 


2. The constitution and functioning of the arbitral tribunal is governed by Annex X. 1. Before initiating the procedure for the application of safeguard measures set out in the following paragraphs of the present Article, the States Parties to this Agreement shall endeavour to solve any differences between them through direct consultations, and inform the other States Parties to this Agreement thereof. 


2. Without prejudice to paragraph 6 of the present Article, a State Party which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the other States Parties and the Joint Committee thereof and supply all relevant information. Consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution. 


3. 	(a) As regards Articles 17 (Rules of competition concerning undertakings) and 18 (State aid), the States Parties concerned shall give to the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to. If the State Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement after consultations, or after thirty days following referral for such consultations, the State Party concerned may adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from the practice in question. 


(b) 	As regards Articles 19 (Dumping), 20 (Emergency action on imports of particular products) and 22 (Re-export and serious shortage), the Joint Committee shall examine the case or the situation and may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the State Party concerned. In the absence of such a decision within thirty days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the State Party concerned may adopt the measures necessary in order to remedy the situation. 


(c) 	As regards Article 31 (Fulfilment of obligations), the State Party concerned shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a commonly acceptable solution. If the Joint Committee fails to reach such a solution or if a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures. 

4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the States Parties to this Agreement and to the Joint Committee. They shall be restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their application and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice or the difficulty in question.  Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. The measures taken by Slovenia against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect the trade with that State. The measures taken against an action or omission of Slovenia may be only taken by that or those EFTA States the trade of which is affected by the said action or omission. 


5. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, substitution or abolition, when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 


6. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the State Party concerned may, in the cases of Articles 19 (Dumping), 20 (Emergency action on imports of particular products) and 22 (Re-export and serious shortage) and in cases of state aid having a direct and immediate incidence on trade between the States Parties, apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation. The measures shall be notified without delay and consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place as soon as possible within the Joint Committee. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a State Party to this Agreement from taking any measures which it considers necessary: 


(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; 


(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the implementation of international obligations or national policies 


(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes, and to such traffic in other goods, materials and services as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; or 


(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and chemical weapons, nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; or 
(iii) 	taken in time of war or other serious international tension. 1. The implementation of this Agreement shall be supervised and administered by a Joint Committee which shall simultaneously act under the Reykjavik Declaration. 


2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of the Agreement, the States Parties to this Agreement shall exchange information and, at the request of any State Party to this Agreement, shall hold consultations within the Joint Committee. The Joint Committee shall keep under review the possibility of further removal of the obstacles to trade between the EFTA States and Slovenia. 


3. The Joint Committee may take decisions in the cases provided for in this Agreement. On other matters the Joint Committee may make recommendations. 1. For the proper implementation of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall meet whenever necessary but normally once a year. Each State Party to this Agreement may request that a meeting be held. 


2. 	The Joint Committee shall act by common agreement. 


3. If a representative in the Joint Committee of a State Party to this Agreement has accepted a decision subject to the fulfilment of constitutional requirements, the decision shall enter into force, if no later date is contained therein, on the date the lifting of the reservation is notified. 


4. For the purpose of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure which shall, inter alia, contain provisions for convening meetings and for the designation of the Chairman and his/her term of office.1 


5. The Joint Committee may decide to set up such sub-committees and working parties as it considers necessary to assist it in accomplishing its tasks.2 1. Where a State Party to this Agreement considers that it would be useful in the interests of the economies of the States Parties to this Agreement to develop and deepen the relations established by the Agreement by extending them to fields not covered thereby, it shall submit a reasoned request to the States Parties to this Agreement. The States Parties to this Agreement may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this request and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with a view to opening negotiations. 


2. Agreements resulting from the procedure referred to in paragraph 1 will be subject to ratification or approval by the States Parties to this Agreement in accordance with their own procedures. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement recognize the growing importance of certain areas, such as services and investments.  In their efforts to gradually develop and broaden their co-operation, in particular in the context of European integration, they will co-operate with the aim of achieving a gradual liberalization and mutual opening of markets for investments and trade in services, taking into account the results of the Uruguay Round as well as any relevant future work under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. 

1 	Rules of procedure were adopted by Joint Committee Decision No. 2 of 1999 (27 May 1999). 

2 	A Sub-Committee on Customs and Origin Matters was established by Joint Committee Decision No. 3 of 1999 (27 May 1999). 

2. The EFTA States and Slovenia will discuss this co-operation in the Joint Committee with the aim of developing and deepening their relations under the Agreement. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall take all necessary measures to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the Agreement and the fulfilment of their obligations under the Agreement. 


2. If an EFTA State considers that Slovenia has, or if Slovenia considers that an EFTA State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Agreement, the State Party concerned may take the appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). The Annexes and the Protocols to this Agreement are an integral part of it. The Joint Committee may decide to amend the Annexes and Protocols. This Agreement applies to trade relations between, on the one side, the individual EFTA States and, on the other side, Slovenia, but not to the trade relations between individual EFTA States, except if otherwise provided for in this Agreement. This Agreement shall apply to the territories of the States Parties to the Agreement. This Agreement shall not prevent the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier trade to the extent that these do not negatively affect the trade regime and, in particular, the provisions concerning rules of origin provided for by this Agreement. Amendments to this Agreement other than those referred to in Article 32 (Annexes and Protocols) which are approved by the Joint Committee shall be submitted to the States Parties to this Agreement for acceptance and shall enter into force if accepted by all the States Parties to this Agreement. The instruments of acceptance shall be deposited with the Depositary. 1. Any State, Member of the European Free Trade Association, may accede to this Agreement, provided that the Joint Committee decides to approve its accession, to be negotiated between the acceding State and the States Parties concerned, on such terms and conditions as may be set out in that decision. The instrument of accession shall be deposited with the Depositary. 


2. In relation to an acceding State, the Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the third month following the deposit of its instrument of accession. 1. Each State Party to this Agreement may withdraw therefrom by means of a written notification to the Depositary. The withdrawal shall take effect six months after the date on which the notification is received by the Depositary. 


2. If Slovenia withdraws, the Agreement shall expire at the end of the notice period, and if all EFTA States withdraw it shall expire at the end of the latest notice period. 


3. Any EFTA Member State which withdraws from the Convention establishing the European Free Trade Association shall ipso facto on the same day as the withdrawal takes effect cease to be a State Party to this Agreement. 1. This Agreement shall enter into force on 1 July 1995 in relation to those Signatory States which by then have deposited their instruments of ratification or acceptance with the Depositary, provided that Slovenia is among the States that have deposited their instruments of ratification or acceptance. 


2. In relation to a Signatory State depositing its instrument of ratification or acceptance after 1 July 1995, this Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following the deposit of its instrument, provided that in relation to Slovenia the Agreement enters into force at the latest on the same date. 


3. Any Signatory State may already at the time of signature declare that, during an initial phase, it shall apply the Agreement provisionally, if the Agreement cannot enter into force in relation to that State by 1July 1995.  For an EFTA State provisional application is only possible provided that in relation to Slovenia the Agreement has entered into force, or that Slovenia is applying the Agreement provisionally. The Government of Norway, acting as Depositary, shall notify all States that have signed or acceded to this Agreement of the deposit of any instrument of ratification, or provisional application, acceptance or accession, as well as of the entry into force of this Agreement, of its expiry or of any withdrawal therefrom. IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned plenipotentiaries, being duly authorized thereto, have signed the present Agreement. 

DONE at Bergen, this 13th day of June 1995, in a single authentic copy in the English language which shall be deposited with the Government of Norway. The Depositary shall transmit certified copies to all Signatory States and States acceding to this Agreement.
AGREEMENT 
BETWEEN 
THE EFTA STATES 
AND 
THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA 


Note: 	Austria, Finland and Sweden withdrew from the Convention establishing the European Free Trade Association (the Stockholm Convention) on 31 December 1994. In accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 37 of the Free Trade Agreement between the EFTA States and Bulgaria these three countries ceased to be Parties to the Agreement on the same day.  Consequently, in the present text, the provisions referring to Austria, Finland and Sweden have been deleted. 

PREAMBLE 


The Republic of Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Kingdom of Norway, and the Swiss Confederation (hereinafter called the EFTA States)  

and 

the Republic of Bulgaria (hereinafter called Bulgaria), 

Recalling their intention to participate actively in the process of economic integration in Europe and expressing their preparedness to co-operate in seeking ways and means to strengthen this process, 

Considering the importance of the traditional links existing between the EFTA States and Bulgaria and the common values they share, and recognizing that the EFTA States and Bulgaria wish to strengthen these links and to establish close and lasting relations,  

Having regard to the Declaration signed by the EFTA States and Bulgaria in Geneva in December 1991, 

Recalling their firm commitment to the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Charter of Paris for a new Europe, and in particular the principles contained in the final document of the CSCE Bonn Conference on Economic Co-operation in Europe, 

Reaffirming their commitment to pluralistic democracy based on the rule of law, human rights, including rights of persons belonging to minorities, and fundamental freedoms, and recalling their membership in the Council of Europe, 

Considering the commitment of the EFTA States and Bulgaria to free trade, and in particular to the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 

Firmly convinced that this Agreement will foster the creation of an enlarged and harmonious free trade area within Europe, thus constituting an important contribution to European integration, 

Bearing in mind the economic and social disparities between the EFTA States and Bulgaria and thus recognizing that the objectives of this Agreement should be reached through its appropriate provisions, 

Resolved to this end to gradually establish a free trade area by eliminating progressively the obstacles to substantially all their trade, in accordance with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 

Declaring their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant factor, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations in order to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement, 

Considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the States Parties to this Agreement from their obligations under other international agreements, 

HAVE DECIDED, in pursuit of the above, to conclude this Agreement: 1. The EFTA States and Bulgaria shall during a transitional period ending on 31 December 2002 gradually establish a free trade area, in accordance with the provisions of the present Agreement. 


2. The objectives of this Agreement, which is based on trade relations between market economies and on the respect of democratic principles and human rights, are: 


(a) 	to promote, through the expansion of mutual trade, the harmonious development of the economic relations between the EFTA States and Bulgaria and thus to foster in the EFTA States and in Bulgaria the advance of economic activity, the improvement of living and employment conditions, and increased productivity and financial stability; 


(b) 	to provide fair conditions of competition for trade between the States Parties to this Agreement; 


(c) 	to contribute in this way, by the removal of barriers to trade, to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade. The Agreement shall apply: 


(a) 	to products falling within Chapters 25 to 97 of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, excluding the products listed in Annex I; 


(b) 	to products specified in Protocol A, with due regard to the arrangements provided for in that Protocol; 


(c) 	to fish and other marine products as provided for in Annex II; 
originating in an EFTA State or Bulgaria. 1. Protocol B lays down the rules of origin and methods of administrative cooperation. 


2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall take appropriate measures, including regular reviews by the Joint Committee and arrangements for administrative cooperation, to ensure that the provisions of Articles 4 to 9, 14 and 23 of the Agreement and Protocol B are effectively and harmoniously applied, and to reduce, as far as possible, the formalities imposed on trade, and to achieve mutually satisfactory solutions to any difficulties arising from the operation of those provisions. 1. No new customs duty on imports or charge having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the EFTA States and Bulgaria. 


2. Upon the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the EFTA States shall abolish all customs duties on imports and any charges having equivalent effect for products originating in Bulgaria, except for products specified in Annex III for which customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect shall be progressively abolished in accordance with the provisions laid down in that Annex. 


3. For the products specified in Annex IV originating in an EFTA State, Bulgaria shall progressively abolish all customs duties on imports and any charges having equivalent effect in accordance with the provisions laid down in that Annex. 1. For each product the basic duty to which the successive reductions set out in this Agreement are to be applied, shall be the Most Favoured Nation rate of duty applied on 31 May 1993. 


2. If, after the entry into force of this Agreement, any tariff reduction is applied on an erga omnes basis, in particular reductions implemented as a result of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations or of the accession of Bulgaria to the GATT, such reduced duties shall replace the basic duties referred to in paragraph 1 as from the date when such reductions are applied.

This Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants and the environment; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; the protection of intellectual property; rules relating to gold or silver; or the conservation of exhaustible natural resources.

(a) 	to hold immediate consultations in the framework of the Joint Committee in case a State Party considers that another State Party has taken measures which are likely to create, or have created, an obstacle to trade, in order to find an appropiate solution; 


(b) 	to discuss in the Joint Committee possibilities to co-operate more closely on matters related to removing obstacles. This co-operation may take place in fields related to technical regulations and standardization as well as testing and certification. 
As amended by Joint Committee Decision No. 8 of 1996 (20 March 1996). 

2. The States Parties to this Agreement commit themselves to notify the technical regulations in accordance with the provisions of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement declare their readiness to foster, in so far as their agricultural policies allow, harmonious development of trade in agricultural products, taking into account its high importance for Bulgaria's economy.

2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall refrain from any exchange or administrative restrictions on the grant, repayment or acceptance of short and medium-term credits covering commercial transactions in which a resident participates. 


3. Until a full convertibility of the Bulgarian currency in the meaning of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund is introduced, Bulgaria reserves the right to apply exchange restrictions connected with the granting or taking up of short and medium-term credits to the extent permitted according to Bulgaria's status under the IMF, provided that these restrictions are applied in a nondiscriminatory manner. They shall be applied in such a manner as to cause the least possible disruption to this Agreement.  Bulgaria shall inform the Joint Committee promptly of the introduction of such measures and of any changes therein. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement consider the effective liberalization of their respective public procurement markets as a desirable and important objective of this Agreement. 


2. As of the entry into force of this Agreement, the  EFTA States shall grant companies from Bulgaria access to contract award procedures on their respective public procurement markets according to the Agreement on Government Procurement of 12 April 1979, as amended by a Protocol of Amendments of 2 February 1987, negotiated under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Bulgaria shall, taking into account the restructuring and development process of its economy, gradually ensure that companies from the EFTA States have access on the same principles to contract award procedures on its public procurement market. 


3. As soon as possible after the entry into force of this Agreement, the States Parties to this Agreement shall progressively develop and adjust the rules, conditions and practices governing the participation in public procurement contracts awarded by public authorities and public undertakings, and by private undertakings which have been granted special or exclusive rights, so as to ensure free access and transparency, and that there is no discrimination between potential suppliers from the States Parties to this Agreement.  A full balance of rights and obligations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall be established not later than at the end of the transitional period. 


4. The Joint Committee shall recommend or agree, as appropriate, the practical modalities for this development including, inter alia, scope, timetable and rules to be applied.

2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall take all necessary measures as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Agreement to comply with the substantive provisions of the multilateral conventions which are specified in Article 2 of Annex X and make best endeavours to adhere to them as well as to multilateral agreements facilitating co-operation in the field of protection of intellectual property rights. 


3. In the field of intellectual property, the States Parties to this Agreement shall not grant treatment less favourable to each others' nationals than that accorded to nationals of any other State.  Any advantage, favour, privilege or immunity deriving from: 


(a) 	bilateral agreements in force for a State Party to this Agreement at the entry into force of this Agreement as notified to the other States Parties by 1 January 1994, 


(b) 	existing and future multilateral agreements, including regional agreements on economic integration, to which not all of the States Parties to this Agreement are Parties, 
may be exempted from this obligation, provided that it does not constitute an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination of nationals of the other States Parties.   

The provisions of sub-paragraph (b) may be subject to consultations and if, need be, to review upon request of any State Party to this Agreement with a view to take into account future developments relating to economic integration. 


4. Two or more States Parties to this Agreement may conclude further agreements exceeding the requirements of this Agreement, provided that such agreements shall be open to all other States Parties to this Agreement on terms equivalent to those under the agreements and that they shall be ready to enter into good faith negotiations to this end. 


5. The States Parties to this Agreement shall agree upon apppropriate modalities for technical assistance and co-operation of respective authorities of the States Parties. To this end, they shall co-ordinate efforts with relevant international organizations. 
Article 17 was amended by Joint Committee Decision No. 7 of 1997 (16 December 1997).  The Decision will enter into force when the instruments of acceptance have been deposited by all Parties with the Depositary.  The Article will then be replaced. 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between an EFTA State and Bulgaria: 


(a) 	all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition; 


(b) 	abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the States Parties to this Agreement as a whole or in a substantial part thereof. 

2. As from the third year from the entry into force of this Agreement, the provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to the activities of public undertakings, and undertakings for which the States Parties to this Agreement grant special or exclusive rights, in so far as the application of these provisions does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular public tasks assigned to them. 


3. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is incompatible with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 and if such practice causes or threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interest of that State Party or material injury to its domestic industry, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25. 1. Any aid granted by a State Party to this Agreement or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it may affect trade between an EFTA State and Bulgaria, be incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement. 


2. Any practices contrary to paragraph 1 should be assessed on the basis of the criteria set out in Annex XI. 


3. For the purpose of applying the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, the States Parties to this Agreement recognize that during the first five years after the entry into force of this Agreement Bulgaria may grant aid with a higher intensity than would be tolerated for EFTA States according to the criteria set out in Annex XI.  The Joint Committee may, taking into account the economic situation of Bulgaria, decide on prolongation of the application of this provision. 


4. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure transparency of state aid measures by exchanging information as provided in Annex XII. 


5. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is incompatible with the provisions of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate measures against this practice, which shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice, under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25. Such measures shall not be contrary to the other international obligations of a State Party. If an EFTA State finds that dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is taking place in trade with Bulgaria, or if Bulgaria finds that dumping within this meaning is taking place in trade with an EFTA State, the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  and with the procedure laid down in Article 25. Where any product is being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause: 


(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products in the territory of the importing State Party to this Agreement, or 


(b) 	serious disturbances in any sector of the economy or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, 
the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 25. 1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the provisions of Article 4 may be taken by Bulgaria in the form of increased customs duties. 


2. These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where these difficulties produce important social problems. 


3. Customs duties on imports applicable in Bulgaria to products originating in the EFTA States introduced by these measures may not exceed 25% ad valorem and shall maintain an element of preference for products originating in the EFTA States.  The total value of imports of the products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 15% of total imports of industrial products from the EFTA States, as defined in Article 2, during the last year for which statistics are available. 


4. These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding five years unless a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee.  They shall cease to apply at the latest at the expiration of the transitional period. 


5. No such measures can be introduced in respect of a product if more than three years have elapsed since the elimination of all duties and quantitative restrictions or charges or measures having an equivalent effect concerning that product. 


6. Bulgaria shall inform the Joint Committee of any exceptional measures it intends to take and, at the request of the EFTA States, consultations shall be held in the Joint Committee on such measures and the sectors to which they apply before they are applied.  When taking such measures Bulgaria shall provide the Joint Committee with a schedule for the elimination of the customs duties introduced under this Article.  This schedule shall provide for a phasing out of these duties starting at the latest two years after their introduction, at equal annual rates.  The Joint Committee may decide on a different schedule. Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 7 and 9 leads to: 


(a) 	re-export towards a third country against which the exporting State Party to this Agreement maintains for the product concerned quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect; or 


(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to the exporting State Party to this Agreement; 
and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting State Party, that State Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25. The measures shall be non-discriminatory and be eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 1. Where an EFTA State or Bulgaria is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the EFTA State or Bulgaria, as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, adopt trade restrictive measures, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The measures shall be progressively relaxed as balance of payments conditions improve and they shall be eliminated when conditions no longer justify this maintenance. The EFTA State or Bulgaria, as the case may be, shall inform the other States Parties to this Agreement and the Joint Committee forthwith of their introduction and, whenever practicable, of a time schedule for their removal.  


2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall, nevertheless, endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance of payments purposes. 1. Before initiating the procedure for the application of safeguard measures set out in the following paragraphs of the present Article, the States Parties to this Agreement shall endeavour to solve any differences between them through direct consultations, and inform the other States Parties to this Agreement thereof. 


2. Without prejudice to paragraph 6 of the present Article, a State Party to this Agreement, which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the other States Parties and the Joint Committee thereof and supply all relevant information. Consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution. 


3. 	(a) As regards Articles 18 and 19, the States Parties concerned shall give to the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to.  If the State Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement after consultations, or after three months following referral for such consultations, the State Party concerned may adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from the practice in question. 


(b) 	As regards Articles 20, 21 and 23, the Joint Committee shall examine the case or the situation and may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the State Party concerned.  In the absence of such a decision within thirty days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the State Party concerned may adopt the measures necessary in order to remedy the situation. 


(c) 	As regards Article 30, the State Party concerned shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a commonly acceptable solution. If the Joint Committee fails to reach such a solution or if a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures. 

4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the States Parties to this Agreement and to the Joint Committee.  They shall be restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their application and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice or the difficulty in question.  Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of the Agreement.  The measures taken by Bulgaria against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect the trade with that State. The measures taken against an action or omission of Bulgaria may be only taken by that or those EFTA States the trade of which is affected by the said action or omission. 


5. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, substitution or abolition as soon as possible. 


6. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the State Party concerned may, in the cases of Articles 20, 21 and 23 and in cases of state aid having a direct and immediate incidence on trade between the States Parties, apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.  The measures shall be notified without delay and consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place as soon as possible within the Joint Committee. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a State Party to this Agreement from taking any measures which it considers necessary: 


(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; 


(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the implementation of international obligations or national policies 


(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes, and to such traffic in other goods, materials and services as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; or 


(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and chemical weapons, nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; or 
(iii) 	taken in time of war or other serious international tension constituting threat of war. 1. Disputes between States Parties to this Agreement relating to the interpretation of rights and obligations of States Parties to this Agreement, which have not been settled through consultation or in the Joint Committee within six months, may be referred to arbitration by any State party to the dispute by means of a written notification addressed to the other State party to the dispute.  A copy of this notification shall be communicated to all States Parties to this Agreement. 


2. The constitution and functioning of the arbitral tribunal is governed by Annex XIV. 


3. The arbitral tribunal shall settle the dispute in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and applicable rules and principles of international law. 


4. The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding upon the States parties to the dispute. 1. The implementation of this Agreement shall be supervised and administered by the Joint Committee established under the Geneva Declaration. 


2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of the Agreement, the States Parties to this Agreement shall exchange information and, at the request of any State Party to this Agreement, shall hold consultations within the Joint Committee. The Joint Committee shall keep under review the possibility of further removal of the obstacles to trade between the EFTA States and Bulgaria. 


3. The Joint Committee may take decisions in the cases provided for in this Agreement. On other matters the Joint Committee may make recommendations. 
Article 26 bis was introduced by Joint Committee Decision No. 8 of 1997 (16 December 1997). 1. For the proper implementation of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall meet whenever necessary but at least once a year.  Each State Party to this Agreement may request that a meeting be held. 


2. The Joint Committee shall act by common agreement. 


3. If a representative in the Joint Committee of a State Party to this Agreement has accepted a decision subject to the fulfilment of constitutional requirements, the decision shall enter into force, if no later date is contained therein, on the day the lifting of the reservation is notified. 


4. For the purpose of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure which shall, inter alia, contain provisions for convening meetings and for the designation of the Chairman and his term of office. 


5. The Joint Committee may decide to set up such sub-committees and working parties as it considers necessary to assist it in accomplishing its tasks. 1. Where a State Party to this Agreement considers that it would be useful in the interests of the economies of the States Parties to this Agreement to develop and deepen the relations established by the Agreement by extending them to fields not covered thereby, it shall submit a reasoned request to the States Parties to this Agreement. The States Parties to this Agreement may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this request and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with a view to opening negotiations. 


2. Agreements resulting from the procedure referred to in paragraph 1 will be subject to ratification or approval by the States Parties to this Agreement in accordance with their own procedures. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall take all necessary measures to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the Agreement and the fulfilment of their obligations under the Agreement. 


2. If an EFTA State considers that Bulgaria has, or if Bulgaria considers that an EFTA State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Agreement, the State Party concerned may take the appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25. The Annexes and the Protocols to this Agreement are an integral part of it. The Joint Committee may decide to amend the Annexes, and Protocols A, B and F. 1. This Agreement applies to trade relations between, on the one side, the individual EFTA States and, on the other side, Bulgaria, but not to the trade relations between individual EFTA States, except if otherwise provided for in this Agreement. 


2. Specific rules on the implementation of this Article are contained in Annex XIII. This Agreement shall not prevent the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier trade to the extent that these do not negatively affect the trade regime and in particular the provisions concerning rules of origin provided for by this Agreement. This Agreement shall apply to the territories of the States Parties to the Agreement. Amendments to this Agreement other than those referred to in Article 31 which are approved by the Joint Committee shall be submitted to the States Parties to this Agreement for acceptance and shall enter into force if accepted by all the States Parties to this Agreement.

TRADE AGREEMENTBETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA AND THE REPUBLIC OF UPPER VOLTA 


The Government of the Republic of Ghana and the Government of the Republic 
of Upper Volta being desirous of expanding and strengthening economic and 
trade relations between both countries in view of the brotherly relations between

and the Republic of Upper Volta both Contracting Parties will grant reciprocally 
the most-favoured nation treatment in respect of all matters relating to trade 
between the two countries.

(a) 	Goods imported from Ghana but originating in other countries

of Upper Volta or to goods originating in other countries which 
do not enjoy most-favoured nation treatment in Ghana except by 
the prior consent in writing of both Contracting parties: 




(b) 	advantages accorded by either Contracting Party to contiguous 
countries for the purpose of facilitating frontier traffic;

and "B" attached to this Agreement and other goods not specifically mentioned

their internal laws and regulations to issue import and export licenses as 
need be and facilitate the exchange of goods in accordance with the provisions 
of this Agremment The contracts within the framework of this Agreement shall be concluded 
between the Ghana legal bodies or Individual persons on the one hand and the 
Upper Volta Foreign Trade Corporation and independent legal bodies or other

Trade on the other hand. Both Contracting Parties within the scope of their internal laws and 
regulations shall exempt from import duty and charges levied within their 
territories samples of goods of all kinds originating in the territory of the 
other Contracting Party if they are of small-value, provided that they are 
used as samples for obtaining orders for respective goods and are not intended 
for trade. 


Subject to the existing Customs Laws concerning temporary importation and 
exportation the Contracting Parties shall grant temporary exemption from customs 
duty and other charges. Any local product or any locally manufactured articles originating from 
either of the Contracting Parties, should cross the frontiers of both States 
freely and should not be subject to any duty at the point of entry but should 
be subject to any conditions imposed by the competent authority of each of the 
two Contracting Parties. Both Contracting Parties have agreed that the goods purchased in the

only be given by the Minister responsible for Commerce on behalf of the Government 
of Ghana or the competent Upper Volta Autihority. 


Both Contracting Parties have agreed not to re-export goods to each other 
originating from a third country without prior approval of both parties. This 
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Both Contracting Parties will make every effort to establish the prices of 
the goods delivered under this Agreement on the basis of world price i.e the 
prices on the main world markets of corresponding goods. The Republic of Ghana shall accord the most-favoured nation treatment to 
the Republic of Upper Volta's merchant vessels and to the cargo of such vessels

interest for both countries, in accordance with the laws, regulations and rules 
existing in their countries in respect of goods in transit. No import duties 
will be charged on transit goods from the country of one Contracting Party 
to the other. In order to promote trade between the two countries, both Contracting 
Parties may organise in either country Trade Fairs and Exhibitions. All payments resulting from contract and transactions concluded under the

for the expansion of mutual trade or to remove any difficulties that may arise 
in connection with the implementation of this Agreement. The Provisions of this Agreement will continue to be applied after its: 
expiry to all contracts which have been concluded but not fully executed prior

enlarged and harmonious free trade area within Europe, thus constituting an 
important contribution to European integration,

Tariffs and Trade, 


Declaring their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant 
factor, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations in 
order to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement, 


Considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as 
exempting the States Parties to this Agreement from their obligations under 
other international agreements, especially the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, 


Have decided, in pursuit of the above, to conclude this Agreement: 1. The EFTA States and Romania shall during a transitional period ending

between market economies and on the respect of democratic principles and 
human rights, are:

harmoniously applied, and to reduce, as far as possible, the formalities

shall be introduced in trade between the EFTA States and Romania. 



2. Upon the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the EFTA States 
shall abolish all customs duties on imports and any charges having

Annex. 1. For each product the basic duty to which the successive reductions set 
out in this Agreement are to be applied, shall be the Most Favoured Nation 
rate of duty applied on 30 April 1993. 



2. If, after the entry into force of this Agreement, any tariff reduction 
is applied on an erga omnes basis, in particular reductions implemented as 
a result of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations or of the 
renegotiation of the Protocol of Accession of Romania to the GATT, such 
reduced duties shall replace the basic duties referred to in paragraph 1 as

applied rounded to the first decimal place or, in case of specific duties, 
to the second decimal place. 1. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 of Article 4 shall also apply to

life of humans, animals or plants and the environment; the protection of 
national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; 


the protection of intellectual property; rules relating to gold or silver; 
or the conservation of exhaustible natural resources, if such measures are 
made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or 
consumption. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, 
constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction 
on trade between the States Parties to this Agreement. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure that any state 
monopoly of a commercial character be adjusted, subject to the provisions 
laid down in Protocol D, so that no discrimination regarding the conditions 
under which goods are procured and marketed will exist between nationals of 
the EFTA States and of Romania. 



2. The provisions of this Article shall apply to any body through which 
the competent authorities of the States Parties to this Agreement, in law 
or in fact, either directly or indirectly supervise, determine or 
appreciably influence imports or exports between the States Parties to this 
Agreement. These provisions shall likewise apply to monopolies delegated 
by the State to others. 1. The EFTA States and Romania shall notify each other, at the earliest

procedure within two years from the entry into force of the Agreement. If 
this does not turn out to be fully possible, the Joint Committee shall 
prolong this period. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement declare their readiness to 
foster, in so far as their agricultural policies allow, harmonious 
development of trade in agricultural products. 



2. In pursuance of this objective each individual EFTA State and Romania 
shall conclude a bilateral arrangement providing for measures to facilitate 
trade in agricultural products. 



3. The States Parties to this Agreement shall apply their regulations in 
veterinary, plant health and health matters in a non-discriminatory fashion 
and shall not introduce any new measures that have the effect of unduly 
obstructing trade. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall refrain from any measure or 
practice of an internal fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or 
indirectly, discrimination between the products originating in an EFTA 
State and like products originating in Romania. 



2. Products exported to the territory of one of the States Parties to 
this Agreement may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in 
excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on them. 1. Payments relating to trade between an EFTA State and Romania and the 
transfer of such payments to the territory of the State Party to this 
Agreement where the creditor resides shall be free from any restrictions. 



2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall refrain from any exchange 
or administrative restrictions on the grant, repayment or acceptance of 
short and medium-term credits covering commercial transactions in which a 
resident participates. 



3. Until a full convertibility of the Romanian currency in the meaning of 
Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary 
Fund is introduced, Romania reserves the right to apply exchange 
restrictions connected with the granting or taking up of short and 
medium-term credits to the extent permitted according to Romania's status 
under the IMF, provided that these restrictions are applied in a 
non-discriminatory manner. They shall be applied in such a manner as to 
cause the least possible disruption to this Agreement. Romania shall 
inform the Joint committee promptly of the introduction of such measures 
and of any changes therein. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement consider the effective 
liberalization of their respective public procurement markets as a 
desirable and important objective of this Agreement. 



2. As of the entry into force of this Agreement, the EFTA States shall 
grant companies from Romania access to contract award procedures on their 

respective public procurement markets according to the Agreement on 
Government Procurement of 12 April 1979, as amended by a Protocol of 
Amendments of 2 February 1987, negotiated under the auspices of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Romania shall, taking into account the 
restructuring and development process of its economy, gradually ensure that 
companies from the EFTA States have access on the same principles to 
contract award procedures on its public procurement market. 



3. As soon as possible after the entry into force of this Agreement, the 
States Parties to this Agreement shall progressively develop and adjust the 
rules, conditions and practices governing the participation in public 
procurement contracts awarded by public authorities and public 
undertakings, and by private undertakings which have been granted special 
or exclusive rights, so as to ensure free access and transparency, and that 
there is no discrimination between potential suppliers from the States 
Parties to this Agreement. A full balance of rights and obligations 
between the States Parties to this Agreement shall be established not later 
than at the end of the transitional period. 



4. The Joint Committee shall recommend or agree, as appropriate, the 
practical modalities for this development including, inter alia, scope, 
timetable and rules to be applied. 



5. The States Parties concerned shall endeavour to accede to the relevant 
Agreements negotiated under the auspices of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall grant and ensure adequate, 
effective and non-discriminatory protection of intellectual property 
rights. They shall adopt and take adequate, effective and 
non-discriminatory measures for the enforcement of such rights against 
infringement thereof, and in particular against counterfeiting and piracy. 
Particular obligations of the States Parties are contained in Annex XI. 



2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall take all necessary measures 
as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Agreement to comply 
with the substantive provisions of the multilateral conventions which are 
specified in Article 2 of Annex XI and shall make best endeavours to adhere 
to them as well as to multilateral agreements facilitating co-operation in 
the field of the protection of intellectual property rights. 



3. In the field of intellectual property, the States Parties to this 
Agreement shall not grant treatment less favourable to each others' 
nationals than that accorded to nationals of any other State. Any 
advantage, favour, privilege or immunity deriving from: 



(a) 	bilateral agreements in force for a State Party to this Agreement 
at the entry into force of this Agreement as notified to the 
other States Parties by 1 January 1994, 



(b) 	existing and future multilateral agreements, including regional 
agreements on economic integration, to which not all of the 
States Parties to this Agreement are Parties, 

may be exempted from this obligation, provided that it does not constitute 
an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination of nationals of the other 
States Parties. 



4. Two or more States Parties to this Agreement may conclude further 
agreements exceeding the requirements of this Agreement, provided that such 
agreements shall be open to all other States Parties to this Agreement on 
terms equivalent to those under the agreements and that they shall be ready 
to enter into good faith negotiations to this end. 



5. The States Parties to this Agreement shall agree upon appropriate 
modalities for technical assistance and co-operation of respective 
authorities of the States Parties to this Agreement. To this end, they 
shall co-ordinate efforts with relevant international organizations. 1. 	The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this 


Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between an EFTA State and 
Romania: 



(a) 	all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of 
undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which 
have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or 
distortion of competition; 



(b) 	abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the 
territories of the States Parties to this Agreement as a whole or 
in a substantial part thereof. 


2. As from the third year from the entry into force of this Agreement, 
the provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to the activities of public 
undertakings, and undertakings for which the Parties grant special or 
exclusive rights, in so far as the application of these provisions does not 
obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular public tasks 
assigned to them. 



3. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is 
incompatible with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 and if such practice 
causes or threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interest of that 
State Party or material injury to its domestic industry, it may take 
appropriate measures after consultations within the Joint Committee or 
after thirty days following referral for such consultation. 1. Any aid granted by a State Party to this Agreement or through State 
resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort 
competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain 
goods shall, in so far as it may affect trade between an EFTA State and 
Romania, be incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement. 



2. Any practices contrary to paragraph 1 should be assessed on the basis 
of criteria set out in Annex XII. 



3. For the purpose of applying the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, the 
States Parties to this Agreement recognize that during the first five years 
after the entry into force of this Agreement Romania shall be regarded as 
an area where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is 
serious unemployment, implying that Romania may grant aid with a higher 
intensity than would be tolerated for EFTA States according to the criteria 
set out in Annex XII. The Joint Committee may, taking into account the 
economic situation of Romania, decide on a prolongation of the application 
of this provision. 



4. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure transparency of 
state aid measures by exchanging information as provided in Annex XIII. 



5. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is 
incompatible with the provisions of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate 
measures against this practice, which shall not be in excess of the injury 
caused by the practice, under the conditions and in accordance with the 
procedures laid down in Article 25. If an EFTA State finds that dumping within the meaning of Article VI 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is taking place in trade with 
Romania, or if Romania finds that dumping within this meaning is taking 
place in trade with an EFTA State, the State Party concerned may take 
appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement 
on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade and with the procedure laid down in Article 25. Where any product is being imported in such increased quantities and 
under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause: 



(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly 
competitive products in the territory of the importing State 
Party to this Agreement, or 



(b) 	serious disturbances in any sector of the economy or difficulties 
which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic 
situation of a region, 

the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the 
conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 25. 1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the 
provisions of Article 4 may be taken by Romania in the form of increased 
customs duties. 



2. These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors 
undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where 
these difficulties produce important social problems. 



3. Customs duties on imports applicable in Romania to products 
originating in the EFTA States introduced by these measures may not exceed 
25 per cent ad valorem and shall maintain an element of preference for 
products originating in the EFTA States. The total value of imports of the 
products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 15 per cent of 
total imports of industrial products from the EFTA States, as defined in 
Article 2, during the last year for which statistics are available. 



4. These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding five years 
unless a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee. They shall 
cease to apply at the latest at the expiration of the transitional period. 



5. No such measures can be introduced in respect of a product if more 
than three years have elapsed since the elimination of all duties and 
quantitative restrictions or charges or measures having an equivalent 
effect concerning that product. 



6. Romania shall inform the Joint Committee of any exceptional measures 
it intends to take and, at the request of the EFTA States, consultations 
shall be held in the Joint Committee on such measures and the sectors to 
which they apply before they are applied. When taking such measures 
Romania shall provide the Joint Committee with a schedule for the 
elimination of the customs duties introduced under this Article. This 
schedule shall provide for a phasing out of these duties starting at the 
latest two years after their introduction, at equal annual rates. The 
Joint Committee may decide on a different schedule. Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 7 and 9 leads to: 



(a) 	re-export towards a third country against which the exporting 
State Party to this Agreement maintains for the product concerned 
quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or 
charges having equivalent effect; or 



(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to 
the exporting State Party to this Agreement; 

and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give 
rise to major difficulties for the exporting Sate Party, that State Party 
may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with 
the procedures laid down in Article 25. The measures shall be 
non-discriminatory and be eliminated when conditions no longer justify 
their maintenance. 1. Where an EFTA State or Romania is in serious balance of payments 
difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the EFTA State or Romania, 
as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, adopt trade restrictive 
measures, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is 
necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The measures shall 
be progressively relaxed as balance of payments conditions improve and they 
shall be eliminated when conditions no longer justify this maintenance. 
The EFTA State or Romania, as the case may be, shall inform the other 
States Parties to this Agreement and the Joint Committee forthwith of their 
introduction and whenever practicable, of a time schedule for their 
removal. 



2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall, nevertheless, endeavour to 
avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance of payments 
purposes. 1. Before initiating the procedure for the application of safeguard 
measures set out in the following paragraphs of the present Article, the 
States Parties to this Agreement shall endeavour to solve any differences 
between them through direct consultations, and inform the other States 
Parties to this Agreement thereof. 



2. Without prejudice to paragraph 6 of the present Article, a State Party 
which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the 
other States Parties and the Joint Committee thereof and supply all 
relevant information. Consultations between the States Parties shall take 
place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a 
commonly acceptable solution. 



3. 	(a) As regards Article 19 the States Parties concerned shall give to 
the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to 
examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice 
objected to. If the State Party in question fails to put an end 
to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint 
Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement 
after consultations, or after thirty days following referral for 
such consultations, the State Party concerned may adopt the 
appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from 
the practice in question. 



(b) 	As regards Articles 20, 21 and 23, the Joint Committee shall 
examine the case or the situation and may take any decision 
needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the State 
Party concerned. In the absence of such a decision within thirty 
days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the 
State Party concerned may adopt the measures necessary in order 
to remedy the situation. 



(c) 	As regards Article 31, the State Party concerned shall supply the 
Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a 
thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a 
commonly acceptable solution. If the Joint Committee fails to 
reach such a solution or if a period of three months has elapsed 
from the date of notification, the State Party concerned may take 
appropriate measures. 


4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the 
States Parties to this Agreement and to the Joint Committee. They shall be 
restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is 
strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their 
application and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice 
or the difficulty in question. Priority shall be given to such measures as 
will least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. The measures taken by 
Romania against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect 
the trade with that State. The measures taken against an action or 
omission of Romania may be only taken by that or those EFTA States the 
trade of which is affected by the said action or omission. 



5. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular 
consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, 
substitution or abolition as soon as possible. 



6. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior 
examination impossible, the State Party concerned may, in the cases of 
Articles 20, 21 and 23 apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional 
measures strictly necessary to deal with the situation. The measures shall 

be notified without delay and consultations between the States Parties to 
this Agreement shall take place as soon as possible within the Joint 
Committee. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a State Party to this 
Agreement from taking any measures which it considers necessary: 



(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its 
essential security interests; 



(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the 
implementation of international obligations or national policies 



(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements 
of war, provided that such measures do not impair the 
conditions of competition in respect of products not 
intended for specifically military purposes, and to such 
traffic in other goods, materials and services as is carried 
on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a 
military establishment; or 



(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and chemical 
weapons, nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; 
or 

(iii) 	taken in time of war or other serious international tension 
constituting threat of war. 1. The implementation of this Agreement shall be supervised and 
administered by the Joint Committee established under the Geneva 
Declaration, which will also have the powers and competences entrusted to 
the Joint Committee under this Agreement. 



2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of the Agreement, the 
States Parties to this Agreement shall exchange information and, at the 
request of any State Party to this Agreement, shall hold consultations 
within the Joint Committee. The Committee shall keep under review the 
possibility of further removal of the obstacles to trade between the EFTA 
States and Romania. 



3. The Joint Committee may take decisions in the cases provided for in 
this Agreement. On other matters the Committee may make recommendations. 1. For the proper implementation of this Agreement the Joint Committee 
shall meet whenever necessary but at least once a year. Each State Party 
to this Agreement may request that a meeting be held. 



2. The Joint Committee shall act by common agreement. 



3. If a representative in the Joint Committee of a State Party to this 
Agreement has accepted a decision subject to the fulfilment of 
constitutional requirements, the decision shall enter into force, if no 
later date is contained therein, on the day the lifting of the reservation 
is notified. 



4. For the purpose of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall adopt its 
rules of procedure which shall, inter alia, contain provisions for 
convening meetings and for the designation of the Chairman and his term of 
office. 



5. The Joint Committee may decide to set up such sub-committees and 
working parties as it considers necessary to assist it in accomplishing its 
tasks. 1. Where a State Party to this Agreement considers that it would be 
useful in the interests of the economies of the States Parties to this 
Agreement to develop and deepen the relations established by the Agreement 
by extending them to fields not covered thereby, it shall submit a reasoned 
request to the States Parties to this Agreement. The States Parties to 
this Agreement may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this request 
and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with 
a view to opening negotiations. 



2. Agreements resulting from the procedure referred to in paragraph 1 
will be subject to ratification or approval by the States Parties to this 
Agreement in accordance with their own procedures. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement recognize the growing importance 
of certain areas, such as services and investments. In their efforts to 
gradually develop and broaden their co-operation, in particular in the 
context of European integration, they will co-operate with the aim of 
achieving a gradual liberalization and mutual opening of markets for 
investments and trade in services, taking into account relevant GATT work. 


2. The EFTA States and Romania will discuss in the Joint Committee¹this 
co-operation with the aim to develop and deepen their relations under the 
Agreement. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall take all necessary measures 
to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the Agreement and the 
fulfilment of their obligations under the Agreement. 



2. If an EFTA State considers that Romania has, or if Romania considers 
that an EFTA State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Agreement, 
the State Party concerned may take the appropriate measures under the 
conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 25. The Annexes and the Protocols to this Agreement are an integral part 
of it. The Joint Committee may decide to amend the Annexes, and 
Protocols A and B. This Agreement applies to trade relations between, on the one side, 
the individual EFTA States and, on the other side, Romania, but not to the 
trade relations between individual EFTA States, except if otherwise 
provided for in this Agreement. This Agreement shall not prevent the maintenance or establishment of 
customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier trade to the 
extent that these do not negatively affect the trade régime and in 
particular the provisions concerning rules of origin provided for by this 
Agreement. 


¹Austria reserves the right not to include transit traffic and transit 
related matters in such discussions and in arrangements which may result 
therefrom. This Agreement shall apply to the territories of the States Parties to 
this Agreement. Amendments to this Agreement other than those referred to in 
Article 32, which are approved by the Joint Committee, shall be submitted 
to the States Parties to this Agreement for acceptance and shall enter into 
force if accepted by all the States Parties to this Agreement. The 
instruments of acceptance shall be deposited with the Depositary. 1. Any State, Member of the European Free Trade Association, may accede 
to this Agreement, provided that the Joint Committee decides to approve its 
accession, to be negotiated between the acceding State and the States 
Parties concerned, on such terms and conditions as may be set out in that 
decision. The instrument of accession shall be deposited with the 
Depositary. 



2. In relation to an acceding State, the Agreement shall enter into force 
on the first day of the third month following the deposit of its instrument 
of accession. 1. Each State Party to this Agreement may withdraw therefrom by means of 
a written notification to the Depositary. The withdrawal shall take effect 
six months after the date on which the notification is received by the 
Depositary. 



2. If Romania withdraws, the Agreement shall expire at the end of the 
notice period, and if all EFTA States withdraw it shall expire at the end 
of the latest notice period. 



3. Any EFTA Member State which withdraws from the Convention establishing 
the European Free Trade Association shall ipso facto on the same day as the 
withdrawal takes effect cease to be a State Party to this Agreement. 1. This Agreement shall enter into force on 1 May 1993 in relation to 
those Signatory States which by then have deposited their instruments of 
ratification or acceptance with the Depositary, provided that Romania is 
among the States that have deposited their instruments of ratification or 
acceptance. 



2. In relation to a Signatory State depositing its instrument of 
ratification or acceptance after 1 May 1993, this Agreement shall enter 
into force on the first day of the second month following the deposit of 
its instrument, provided that in relation to Romania the Agreement enters 
into force at the latest on the same date. 



3. Any Signatory State may already at the time of signature declare that, 
during an initial phase, it shall apply the Agreement provisionally, if the 
Agreement cannot enter into force in relation to that State by 1 May 1993, 
provided that in relation to Romania the Agreement has entered into force. The Government of Sweden, acting as Depositary, shall notify all 
States that have signed or acceded to this Agreement of the deposit of any 
instrument of ratification, acceptance or accession, as well as of the 
entry into force of this Agreement, of its expiry or of any withdrawal

The Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland hereby become Parties 
to the Association Agreement between the European Economic 
Community and Turkey arnd also to the Declarations annexed to 
the Final Act signed. at Ankara on 12 September 1963 and to the 
Final Act si.ged at Brussels on 23 November 1970. The texts of the Association Agreement, including the 
Protoco2.s which form an integral part thereof and also the 
Declarations referred to in Article 1, drawn up in the English 
and Danish languages and annexed to this Protocol, are 
authentic in the same way as the original texts. Article 12 of the Additional Protocol shall, from 
paragraph 4 onwards, be amended as follows: 



"14. The Association Council may also, during the 
transition period decide that the right available 
to Turkey under paragraph 3 may entitle it to introduce quotas, instead of reintroducing, increasing 
or imposing customs duties, provided that such quota 
is not lower than 60% of the imports from the 
Community of the product in question during the 
preceding year. The value of imports from the 
Community in 1967 of the products affected by these 
quota measures must be counted against the total 
value or the imports referred to in the first 
subparagraph of paragraph 3. 


The Association Council shall lay down the 
conditions governing the application and termination 
of these measures. 


5. 	Notwithstanding paragraph 4 and for the period 
during which Turkey applies the degree of consolidated liberalization fixed at 40% in accordance 
with Article 22 (2) and (3), the following rules 
shall be applicable: 


Ifr the Association Council has not taken a 
decision under paragraph 4, within six months of a 
request being made, Turkey may, after informing the 
Association Council and not earlier than cone year 
after making its request, introduce quotas on the 
terms indicated in paragraph 4. 


All such quotas shall not affect more than 5% of 
the total value of imports in 1967 from the Community 
as originally constituted. The value of imports in 
1967 which are affected by quota measures shall be 
calculated on the basis of imports from the Community 
as originally constituted and shall be charged 
against the value referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 3. If, however, these quotas 
affect products added to the list when the degree of 
consolidated liberalization was raised in accordance 
with Article 22 (4), the value of imports shall be 
calculated on the basis of imports in 1967 from the 
original Member States and the new Member States. 


Turkey shall, at the same time, add new 
products to the list of liberalized products 
consolidated in accordance with Article 22 (4) in 
order to ensure that the value of imports from the 
Community of all the products listed does not fall. 


Consultations may be held within the Association 
Council on the progressive elimination of restrictive 
measures introduced by Turkey pursuant to this 
paragraph. 


6. 	Tlhe Association Council may derogate from 
paragraphs 1, 3,94 and 5." 1. 	For the purposes of Article 12, Article 22 (2) and (5) 
and Article 25 of the Additional Protocol, the level of 
imports to be taken into consideration from the Community 
shall, when being calculated, include, among imports from 
the Community in its original composition, Turkish imports 
from the new Member States during the period under 
consideration. 


However, for the purposes of Article 22 (2) of the 
Additional Protocol, this rule shall apply only to 
increases in the degree of consolidated liberalization to 
be effected by Turkey after 1 January 1976. 


2. 	On the entry into force of this Protocol, Turkey may 
make amendments to the list of liberalised products which 
it has supplied in accordance with Article 22 (4) of the 
Additional Protocol, provided that: 


-these amendments do not affect more than 10% of the 
value of imports from the Community in 1967 of products 
contained in the list, 


-the value of imports from the Community of all the 
products contained in the list of liberalized products, 
calculated as before on the basis of the figures for 
1967, does not fall, 


-for products removed from the list of liberalized 
products, quotas are opened which are not less than 60% 
of imports of these products from the Community during 
the preceding year, without prejudice to the right of 
Turkey to apply to these products the provisions of 
Article 22 (5) of the Additional Protocol. 



The value of imports from the Community which are 
affected by these amendments shall be counted against the 
total value of imports referred to in the first subparagraph 
of Article 12 (3) of the Additional Protocol. 


Turkey shall notify the Association Council of 
measures taken in pursuance of the above provisions. The following shall be substituted for Article 29 (1) of 
the Association Agreement: 


"This Agreement shall apply to the European 
territories of the Kingdom of Belgium, of the Kingdom 
of Denmark, of the Federal Republic of Germany, of the 
French Republic, of Ireland, of the Italian Republic, 
of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, of the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands and of the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
aPnd Northern Ireland and to the other European 
territories for whose external affairs a Member State 
assumes responsibility in accordance with the conditions 
laid down by the Treaty establishing the European 
Economic Community, on the one hand, and to the 
territory of the Republic of Turkey, on the other." The periodic reviews provided for in Article 35 (3) of 
the Additional Protocol shall be brought forward by one year. The annual tariff quotas laid down for Turkey in the Sole 
Article (1) of Annex 1 and in Article 1 (2) of Annex 2 of the 
Additional Protocol shall be increased to: 


Refined petroleum products (headings and subheadings Nos 27.10, 


27.11, 27.12, ex 27.13 B, 27.14 C 


of the Common Customs Tariff): 


............... 340,000 metric tons 


Cotton yarn, not put up for retail sale 
(heading No 55.05 of the Common 


Customs Tariff): 


...................390 metric tons 


Other woven fabrics of cotton 


(heading No 55.09 of the Common 
Customs Tariff): 


............... 1,390 metric tons. The amount of 242 million units 'of account replaces 
the amount of 195 million units of account in Article 3 (2) 
of the Financial Protocol of 23 November 1970. 1. 	The reductions in customs duties and charges having 
equivalent effect which are provided for in the 
Association Agreement shall be applied in the new Member 
States, in accordance with the percentages and timetable 
laid down, upon entry into force of this Protocol. The 
rates resulting from application of these reductions as 
regards Annex 2 and Annex 6 of the Additional Protocol may, 
however, in no case, be lower than those applied by the new 
Member States to the Community as originally constituted. 



2. 	By way of derogation from paragraph 1, in respect of 
the products listed in Annex I, customs duties equal to the 
duties applied to Member States other than the United 
Kingdom may be applied with regard to Turkey by Ireland 
until 31 December 1975. 



3. 	The rates on the basis of which the new Member States 
apply to Turkey the reductions provided for in paragraph I 
shall be those which they apply at the time to third 
countries. 



4. 	By way of derogation from the preceding paragraphs, 
should the application of these provisions temporarily 
result in tariff movements away from alignment on the final 
duty, Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom may maintain 
their duties until the level of those duties has been 
reached on the occasion of a subsequent alignment, or they 
may apply the duty resulting from a subsequent alignment as 
soon as this alignment reaches or passes the said level. The new Member States shall align their customs duties 
of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of these duties, 
relating to the products listed in Annex 2, on the duties 
provided for in the Association Agreement by applying to 
Turkey the same treatment as that applied to other Member 
States. 


Article 9 shall apply to the protective element of 
these duties. 1. 	In respect of the new Member States, Turkey shall 
reduce the difference between the customs duties and 
charges having equivalent effect which it applies to third 
countries and those which it applies to the Community as 
originally constituted under the Association Agreement by 
instalments of 20% in accordance with the following 
timetable: 


-the first alignment shall be carried out as from the 
entry into force of this Protocol; 


-the four succeeding alignments shall be made on 
I January 1974, 1 January 1975, 1 January 1976 and 
1 July 1977. 


2. 	If this Protocol enters into force after 
1 January 1974, Turkey shall apply to the new Member 
States the level of alignment resulting from the timetable 
shown in paragraph I as from its entry into force. 




3. 	In the event of any change in the timetable or in the 
rate of reduction laid down for the abolition of the 
customs duties and charges having equivalent effect. 
applied by the new Member States to the Community as 
originally constituted, the Association Council shall 
take the measures necessary to take account of such a 
change. 



4. 	The Association Council may adopt suitable measures 
to ensure that the reductions to be applied by Turkey to 
the new Member States coincide with the time-limits 
provided for in the Additional Protocol. The preferential treatment provided for in the 
Additional Protocol shall also apply to goods manufactured 
in Turkey using products from a Member State or from a new 
Member State that were not in free circulation in Turkey. 


The application of these provisions to the said goods 
in a new Member State or in one of the original Member 
States may, however, be subject to the imposition in 
Turkey of a levy as long as the duties and charges having 
equivalent effect applied in respect of trade between the 
Member States and Turkey are different from those applied 
in respect of trade between the original Member States and 
the new Member States. 


Article 3 of the Additional Protocol shall be applicable 
mutatis mutandis. 1. 	The import arrangements applied by Ireland in 
respect of products listed in Annex III shall be eliminated 
with regard to Turkey not later than I. July 1975 and 
I January 1985 respectively, in accordance with 
procedures to be determined by the Association Council. 



2. 	Until 31 December 1974 imports into the United. 
Kingdom from Turkey of the products listed in Annex IV of 
this Protocol may be limited to the following annual 
quotas: 

-1973 quota: 306 metric tons 


-


1974 quota: 368 metric tons. During a period ending 1 July 1977 the tariff quotas 
provided for in Article 1(2) of Annex II of the Additional 
Protocol shall be allocated as follows: 


Cotton yarn, not put up for retail sale 
(heading No 55.05 of the Common Customs Tariff): 


-Community as 

originally constituted: 

300 metric tons 
-Denmark 



: 

40 metric tons 
-Ireland 



: 

10 metric tons 
-United Kingdom 

: 

40 metric tons 
Other woven fabrics of cotton (heading No 55.09 of the Common 
Customs Tariff): 


-Community as originally constituted: 1,000 metric tons 
-Denmark 20 metric tons 
-Ireland 10 metric tons 
-United Kingdom 360 metric tons 1. 	During the period specified in Article i4 the minimum 
price laid down in Article 4(3) of Annex 6 to the 
Additional Protocol shall, in the new Member States,-he 
calculated by reference to the incidence of the duties 
they apply at the time with regard to third countries. 



2. 	During the same period the levies and variable and 
fixed components referred to in Annex 6 to the Additional 
Protocol shall, in the new Member States, be calculated 
by reference to the rates they apply at the time with 
regard to third countries. This Protocol and the Annexes thereto form an integral 
part of the Agreement establishing an Association between 
the European Economic Community and Turkey. 1. 	This Protocol will be ratified by the Signatory 
States in accordance with their respective constitutional 
procedures and validly concluded for the Community by a 
decision of the Council of the European Communities 
taken in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty 
establishing the Community and notified to the other 
Parties hereto. 


The instruments of ratification and the notification 
of conclusion shall be exchanged in Brussels. 


2. 	This Protocol shall enter into force on the first 
day of the month following the day on which the 
instruments referred to in paragraph 1 are exchanged. This Protocol is drawn up in two copies in the Danish, 
Dutch, English, French, German, Italian and Turkish 
languages, each of these texts being authentic. TIL BEKRfiFTELSE HERAF har undertegnede befuldmmgtigede under

1. The Contracting Parties shall establish a free-trade area, comprising the Republic of Estonia and the Home Government of the Faroe Islands, in accordance with the provisions of the present Agreement. 


2. 	The objectives of this Agreement are: 


(a) 	to promote, through the expansion of reciprocal trade, the harmonious development of the economic relations between the Contracting Parties and thus to foster the advance of economic activity, the improvement of living and employment conditions, and increased productivity and financial stability; 


(b) 	to provide fair conditions of competition for trade between the Contracting Parties; 


(c) 	to contribute in this way, by the removal of barriers to trade, to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade. This Agreement shall apply: 

(a) 	to products falling within Chapters 01 to 97 of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System originating in Estonia or the Faroe Islands. No new customs duties on imports and exports or charges having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Contracting Parties. 

2. The Contracting Parties shall abolish between them on the date of entry into force of this Agreement all customs duties on imports and exports and all charges having equivalent effect.  The paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article should be applied according to Protocol 1 of this Agreement. The provisions of Article 3 shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. 1. No new quantitative restrictions on imports and exports or measures having equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the Contracting Parties. 


2. All quantitative restrictions on imports and exports and measures having equivalent effect shall be abolished on the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 1. The provisions of this Chapter shall not restrict in any way the pursuance of the respective agricultural policies of the Contracting Parties or the taking of any measures under such policies, including the implementation of the respective provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture within the framework of the World Trade Organization. 


2. The Contracting Parties shall notify each other of changes in their respective agricultural policies pursued or measures applied which may affect the conditions of agricultural trade between them as provided for in this Agreement. Prompt consultations shall be held in the Joint Committee, upon request of any Contracting Party, to examine the situation. Notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement and, in particular, Article 24, if, given the particular sensitivity of the agricultural markets, imports of products originating in a Contracting Party, which are subject to concessions granted under this Agreement, cause serious disturbance to the markets of the other Contracting Party, the Contracting Party concerned shall enter into consultations immediately to find the appropriate solution. Pending such solution, the Contracting Party concerned may take the measures it deems necessary. The Contracting Parties shall apply their regulations in veterinary, health and plant health matters in a non-discriminatory fashion and shall not introduce any new measures  that have the effect of unduly obstructing trade. 1. Protocol 2 to this Agreement lays down the rules of origin and related methods of administrative co-operation. 


2. The Contracting Parties shall take appropriate measures, including regular reviews by the Joint Committee and arrangements for administrative co-operation. 1. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure or practice of an internal fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or indirectly, discrimination between the products originating in the Contracting Parties. 


2. Products exported to the territory of one of the Contracting Parties may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on them. Payments relating to trade and the transfer of such payments to the territory of the Contracting Party, depending on where the creditor resides, shall be free from any restrictions. This Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on the grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of human, animal or plant life or health; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; the protection of intellectual property or rules relating to gold or silver or to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Contracting Parties. 1. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Contracting Party from taking any measure, which it considers necessary: 


(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; 


(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the implementation of international obligations or national policies; 


(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes, and to such traffic in other goods, materials and services as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; or 


(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and chemical weapons, nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; or 
(iii) 	taken in time of war or other serious international tension. 1.

possibility of developing and deepening their relations in order to extend 
them to fields not covered by this Protocol, in particular to investment 
protection, economic assistance as well as economic, industrial and 
scientific co-operation. 1. If an increase in imports of a given product originating in the 
territory of one of the Parties occurs in quantities or under conditions as 
to cause, or threaten to cause disruption to the domestic market or 
production of the other Party, the Party concerned may request that 
consultations on the situation be held without delay in the Joint Commission

2. The Chairman shall convene the meetings of the Joint Commission at 
least once a year in order to review the general functioning of the 
Protocol. The Joint Commission shall, in addition, meet whenever special 
circumstances so require, at the request of either Party.

4. If one of the Parties considers that the other Party has failed to fulfil the obligations under this Article, Article 23 (Fulfilment of obligations), paragraph 2 shall apply. 


5. The Parties to this Agreement shall agree upon appropriate modalities for technical assistance and cooperation of respective authorities of the Parties. 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between the Parties: 


(a) 	all agreements between the undertakings, decisions taken by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition; 


(b) 	abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Parties as whole or in a substantial part thereof. 
2. If a Party considers that a given practice is incompatible with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, it may take appropriate measures after consultations within the Joint Committee or after thirty days following referral to such consultations. 1.

3. The Joint Committee shall keep the situation regarding the application of state-aid measures under review, and shall with regard to other state-aid than export aid, elaborate further rules of implementation.

If a Party considers that a given practice is incompatible with paragraph 1 of this Article, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures) of this Agreement. If a Party finds that dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is taking place in trade relations governed by this Agreement, it may take appropriate measures against that practice in accordance with that Article and Agreements related to, under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures) of this Agreement. If an increase in imports of a given product originating in Estonia or in Ukraine occurs in quantities or under conditions which cause, or are likely to cause: 


(a) 	serious injury to domestic procedures of like or directly competitive products in the territory of the other Party; or 


(b) 	serious disturbances in any related sector of the economy or difficulties, which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, 
the Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures) of this Agreement. Exceptional measures may only concern infant industries or certain sectors undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where these difficulties produce important social problems. 

These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding five years unless a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee, and cannot be introduced later than five years after the entry into force of this Agreement. Where compliance with the provisions of Article 6 (Prohibition and abolition of customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect) and Article 7 (Prohibition and abolition of quantitative restrictions on imports or exports and measures having equivalent effect) leads to: 


(a) 	re-exports towards a third country against which the exporting Party maintains for the products concerned quantitative export restriction, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect; or 


(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to the exporting Party; 
and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 20 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures) of this Agreement. 1. Where either Party is in serious balance-of-payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the Party concerned may, in accordance with the terms and conditions established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT/WTO) and associated legal instruments, adopt trade restrictive measures, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance-of-payments situation.  The Parties shall give preference to price-based measures. The measures shall be eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance.  Parties shall inform each other forthwith of their introduction and of the time schedule for their removal. 


2. The Parties shall, nevertheless, endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance-of-payments purposes. 1. Without prejudice to paragraph 5 of this Article, the Party which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the other Party thereof and supply with all relevant information. Consultations shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a mutually acceptable solution. 

2 (a) 	As regards Article 14 (State-aid) the Party concerned shall give to the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate this practice.  If the Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement after consultations, or after thirty days following referral to such consultations, the Party concerned may adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from the practice in question. 


(b) 	As regards Articles 15 (Dumping), 16 (Emergency action on import of a particular product) and 18 (Re-exports and serious shortage), the Joint Committee shall examine the case or the situation and may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the Party concerned.  In the absence of such a decision within thirty days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the Party concerned may adopt the measures necessary in order to remedy the situation. 


(c) 	As regards Article 23 (Fulfilment of obligations), the Party concerned shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking mutually acceptable solution. If the Joint Committee fails to reach such a solution or if a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, the Party concerned may take appropriate measures. 

3. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the other Party.  They shall be restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their application and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice of the difficulty in question.  Priority shall be given to such measures as the least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. 


4. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular consultations with a view to their relaxation, substitution or abolition as soon as possible. 


5. Where exceptional circumstances required immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Party concerned may, in the case of Articles 13 (Rules of competition concerning undertakings), 14 (State-aid), 15 (Dumping), 16 (Emergency action on imports of a particular product) and 18 (Re-exports and serious shortage) apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional measures strictly necessary to deal with the situation.  The measures shall be notified to the Joint Committee without delay and consultations between the Parties shall take place as soon as possible. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Party from taking any measures which it considers necessary: 


(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; 


(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the implementation of international obligations or national policies: 

(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes, and to such traffic in other goods, materials and services as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; or 


(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and chemical weapons, nuclear weapon, or other nuclear weapons explosive devices; or 
(iii) 	taken in time of war or other serious international tension. The Parties shall recognize the growing importance of such areas as services, investments and the implementation of joint projects.  Where a Party considers that it would be useful in the interests of the economies of the Parties to develop and deepen the relations established by this Agreement by extending them to fields not covered thereby, it shall submit a reasoned request to the other Party. The Parties may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this request and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with a view to opening up negotiations. 1. The Parties shall take all necessary measures to ensure the achievement of the objectives of this Agreement and the fulfilment of their obligations under this Agreement. 


2. If either Party considers that the other Party has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Agreement, the Party concerned may take the appropriate measures after consultation in the Joint Committee under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). The Annexes and Protocols to this Agreement are integral parts of it. This Agreement shall not prevent the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free-trade areas or arrangements for frontier trade to the extent that these do not negatively affect the trade regime and in particular the provisions concerning rules of origin provided by this Agreement. Amendments to this Agreement shall be submitted to the Parties for acceptance and shall enter into force in accordance with Article 27 of this Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force thirty days after the date when both Parties have notified each other in writing and the constitutional or other legal requirements for the entry into force have been fulfilled.  The Agreement shall remain in force for an inadequate period. Either Party may denounce this Agreement by means of a written notification to the other Party. This Agreement shall cease to be in force six months after the date on which the notification was received by the other Party. IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned plenipotentiaries, being duly authorized thereto, have signed the present Agreement.

the CSFR shall abolish all customs duties on imports and charges having 
equivalent effect in accordance with the provisions laid down in that 
Annex. 1. For each product the basic duty to which the successive reductions set 
out in this Agreement are to be applied, shall in respect of the EFTA 
States be the most-favoured-nation rate of duty applicable on 
1 October 1991. 



2. The basic duty in respect of the CSFR shall be the 
most-favoured-nation rate of duty applicable on 1 January 1992. 



3. If, after the entry into force of this Agreement, any tariff reduction 
is applied on an erga omnes basis, in particular reductions resulting from 
the tariff agreement concluded as a result of the Uruguay Round of 
Multilateral Trade Negotiations, such reduced duties shall replace the 
basic duties referred to in paragraph 1 as from that date. 



4. The reduced duties calculated in accordance with Article 4 shall be 
applied rounded to the first decimal place or, in case of specific duties, 
to the second decimal place. 1. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 of Article 4 shall also apply to 
customs duties of a fiscal nature, except as provided for in Protocol C.

fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty by an internal tax. 1. No new customs duty on exports or charge having equivalent effect 
shall be introduced in trade between the EFTA States and the CSFR.

3. Quantitative restrictions and measures having equivalent effect on 
imports into the CSFR shall be abolished on the date of entry into force of 
the Agreement, except as provided for in Annex VII. 1. No new quantitative restriction on exports or measures having 
equivalent effect shall be introduced in trade between the EFTA States and 
the CSFR. 



2. Quantitative restrictions on exports from the EFTA States and measures 
having equivalent effect shall be abolished on the date cf entry into force 
of the Agreement except as provided for in Annex VIII. 

3. Quantitative restrictions on exports from the CSFR and measures having 
equivalent effect shall be abolished on the date of entry into force of the 
Agreement except as provided for in Annex IX. This Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on 
imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public 
morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and 
life of humans, animals or plants and the environment; the protection of 
national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; 
the protection of intellectual property; rules relating to gold or silver; 
or the conservation of exhaustible natural resources, if such measures are 
made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or 
consumption. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, 
constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction 
on trade between the States Parties to this Agreement. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure that any State 
monopoly of a commercial character be adjusted, subject to the provisions 
laid down in Protocol D, so that no discrimination regarding the conditions 
under which goods are procured and marketed will exist between nationals of 
the EFTA States and of the CSFR. 



2. The provisions of this Article shall apply to any body through which 
the competent authorities of the States Parties to this Agreement, in law 
or in fact, either directly or indirectly supervise, determine or 
appreciably influence imports or exports between the States Parties to this 
Agreement. These provisions shall likewise apply to monopolies delegated 
by the State to others. The EFTA States and the CSFR shall notify each other, at the earliest 
practicable stage and in accordance with the provisions laid down in 
Annex X, of draft technical regulations and draft amendments thereto which 
they intend to issue. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement declare their readiness to 
foster, in so far as their agricultural policies allow. harmonious 
development of trade in agricultural products. 



2. In pursuance of this objective each individual EFTA State and the CSFR 
shall conclude a bilateral arrangement providing for measures to facilitate 
trade in agricultural products. 



3. The States Parties to this Agreement shall apply their regulations in 
veterinary, plant health and health matters in a non-discriminatory fashion 
and shall not introduce any new measures that have the effect of unduly 
obstructing trade. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall refrain from any measure or 
practice of an internal fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or 
indirectly, discrimination between the products originating in an EFTA 
State and like products originating in the CSFR. 



2. Products exported to the territory of one of the States Parties to 
this Agreement may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in 
excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on them. 1. Payments relating to trade between an EFTA State and the CSFR and the 
transfer of such payments to the territory of the State, Party to this 
Agreement, where the creditor resides shall be free from any restrictions. 



2. The Parties shall refrain from any exchange or administrative 
restrictions on the grant, repayment or acceptance of short-and 
medium-term credits covering commercial transactions in which a resident 
participates. 



3. Until a full convertibility of the CSFR currency in the meaning of 
Article VIII of the International Monetary Fund is introduced, the CSFR 
reserves the right to apply exchange restrictions connected with the 
granting or taking up of short-and medium-term credits to the extent 
permitted according to the CSFR's status under the IMF, provided that these 
restrictions are applied in a non-discriminatory manner. They shall be 
applied in such a manner as to cause the least possible disruption to this 

Agreement. The CSFR shall inform the Joint Committee promptly of the 
introduction of such measures and of any changes therein. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement consider the effective 
liberalization of their respective public procurement markets as a 
desirable and important objective of this Agreement. 



2. As of the entry into force of this Agreement, the EFTA States shall 
grant companies from the CSFR access to contract award procedures on their 
respective public procurement markets according to the Agreement on 
Government Procurement of 12 April 1979, as amended by a Protocol of 
Amendments of 2 February 1987 negotiated under the auspices of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The CSFR shall, taking into account the 
restructuring and development process of its economy, gradually ensure that 
companies from the EFTA States have access on the same principles to 
contract award procedures on its public procurement market. 



3. As soon as possible after the entry into force of the Agreement the 
States Parties to this Agreement shall progressively develop and adjust the 
rules, conditions and practices governing the participation in public 
procurement contracts awarded by public authorities and public 
undertakings, and by private undertakings which have been granted special 
or exclusive rights, so as to ensure free access and transparency, and that 
there is no discrimination between potential suppliers from the States 
Parties to this Agreement. A full balance of -ights and obligations 
between the States Parties to this Agreement shall be established not later 
than at the end of the transitional period. 



4. The Joint Committee shall recommend or agree, as appropriate, the 
practical modalities for this development including, inter alia, scope, 
timetable and rules to be applied. 



5. The States Parties to this Agreement concerned shall endeavour to 
accede to the relevant Agreements negotiated under the auspices of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall grant and ensure adequate, 
effective and non-discriminatory protection of intellectual property 
rights, including measures for the enforcement of such rights against 
infringement thereof, counterfeiting and piracy. Particular obligations 
are contained in Annex XI. 



2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall not grant treatment less 
favourable to nationals of each other in the field of intellectual property 
than that accorded to nationals of any other country. Any advantage, 
favour, privilege or immunity deriving from: 



(a) 	bilateral agreements in force for a State Party to this Agreement 
at the entry into force of this Agreement as notified to the 
other States Parties by 1 January 1993, 



(b) 	existing and future multilateral agreements, including regional 
agreements on economic integration to which not all of the States 
Parties to this Agreement are Parties, 

may be exempted from this obligation, provided that it does not constitute 
an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination of nationals of the other 
States Parties. 


The provision of sub-paragraph (b) may be subject to consultations 
and, if need be, to review upon request of any State Party to this 
Agreement with a view to take into account future developments relating to 
economic integration. 


3. Two or more States Parties to this Agreement may conclude further 
agreements exceeding the requirements of this Agreement, provided that such 
agreements shall be open to all other States Parties to this Agreement on 
terms equivalent to those under the agreements and that they shall be ready 
to enter into good faith negotiations to this end. 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this 
Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between an EFTA State and the 
CSFR: 



(a) 	all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of 
undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which 
have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or 
distortion of competition; 



(b) 	abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the 
territories of the States Parties to this Agreement as a whole or 
in a substantial part thereof. 

2. As from the third year from the entry into force of this Agreement, 
the provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to the activities of public 
undertakings, and undertakings for which the Parties grant special or 
exclusive rights, in so far as the application of these provisions does not 
obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular public tasks 
assigned to them. 



3. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is 
incompatible with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 and if such practice 
causes or threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interest of that 
State Party or material injury to its domestic industry, it may take 
appropriate measures after consultations within the Joint Committee or 
after thirty days following referral for such consultation. 1. Any aid granted by a State Party to this Agreement or through State 
resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort 
competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain 
goods shall, in so far as it may affect trade between an EFTA State and the 
CSFR, be incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement. 



2. Any practices contrary to paragraph 1 should be assessed on the basis 
of the criteria set out in Annex XII. 



3. For the purpose of applying the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, the 
States Parties to this Agreement recognize that during the first five years 
after the entry into force of this Agreement the CSFR shall be regarded as 
an area where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is 
serious unemployment, implying that the CSFR may grant aid with a higher 
intensity than would be tolerated for EFTA States according to the criteria 
set out in Annex XII. The Joint Committee may, taking into account the 
economic situation of the CSFR, decide on prolongation of the application 
of this provision. 



4. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure transparency of 
state aid measures by exchanging information as provided in Annex XIII. 



5. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is 
incompatible with the provisions of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate 
measures against this practice, which shall not be in excess of the injury 
caused by the practice, under the conditions and in accordance with the 
procedures laid down in Article 25. If an EFTA State finds that dumping within the meaning of Article VI 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is taking place in trade with 
the CSFR, or if the CSFR finds that dumping within this meaning is taking 
place in trade with an EFTA State, the State Party concerned may take 
appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement 
on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade and with the procedure laid down in Article 25. Where any product is being imported in such Increased quantities and 
under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause: 



(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly 
competitive products in the territory of the importing State 
Party to this Agreement, or 



(b) 	serious disturbances in any sector of the economy or difficulties 
which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic 
situation of a region, 

the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the 
conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 25. 1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the 
provisions of Article 4 may be taken by the CSFR in the form of increased 
customs duties. 



2. These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors 
undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where 
these difficulties produce important social problems. 



3. Customs duties on imports applicable in the CSFR to products 
originating in the EFTA States introduced by these measures may not exceed 
25 per cent ad valorem and shall maintain an element of preference for 
products originating in the EFTA States. The total value of imports of the 
products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 15 per cent of 
total imports of industrial products from the EFTA States as defined in 
Article 2 during the last year for which statistics are available. 



4. These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding five years 
unless a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee. They shall 
cease to apply at the latest at the expiration of the transitional period. 



5. No such measures can be introduced in respect of a product if more 
than three years have elapsed since the elimination of all duties and 
quantitative restrictions or charges or measures having an equivalent 
effect concerning that product. 



6. The CSFR shall inform the Joint Committee of any exceptional measures 
it intends to take and, at the request of the EFTA States, consultations 
shall be held in the Joint Committee on such measures and the sectors to 
which they apply before they are applied. When taking such measures the 

CSFR shall provide the Joint Committee with a schedule for the elimination 
of the customs duties introduced under this Article. This schedule shall 
provide for a phasing out of these duties starting at the latest two years 
after their introduction, at equal annual rates. The Joint Committee may 
decide on a different schedule. Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 7 and 9 leads to: 



(a) 	re-export towards a third country against which the exporting 
State Party to this Agreement maintains for the product concerned 
quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or 
charges having equivalent effect; or 



(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to 
the exporting State Party to this Agreement; 

and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give 
rise to major difficulties for the exporting State Party, that State Party 
may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with 
the procedures laid down in Article 25. 1. Where an EFTA State or the CSFR is in serious balance-of-payments 
difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the EFTA State or the CSFR, 
as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, adopt trade restrictive 
measures, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is 
necessary to remedy the balance-of-payments situation. The measures shall 
be progressively relaxed as balance-of-payments conditions improve and they 
shall be eliminated when conditions no longer justify this maintenance. 
The EFTA State or the CSFR, as the case my be, shall inform the other 
States Parties to this Agreement and the Joint Committee forthwith of their 
introduction and, whenever practicable, of a time schedule for their 
removal. 



2. 	The States Parties to this Agreement shall, nevertheless, endeavour to 

avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance-of-payments 
purposes. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a State Party to this 
Agreement from taking any measures which it considers necessary: 



(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its 
essential security interests; 



(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the 
implementation of international obligations or national policies 



(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements 
of war, provided that such measures do not impair the 
conditions of competition in respect of products not 
intended for specifically military purposes, and to such 
traffic in other goods, materials and services as is 
carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of 
supplying a military establishment; or 



(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and 
chemical weapons, nuclear weapons or other nuclear 
explosive devices; or 

(iii) 	taken in time of war or other serious international 
tension. 1. The implementation of this Agreement shall be supervised and 
administered by a Joint Committee. The work of the Joint Committee shall 
be co-ordinated with the Joint Committee established under the Gothenburg 
Declaration. 



2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of the Agreement, the 
States Parties to this Agreement shall exchange information and, at the 
request of any State Party to this Agreement, shall hold consultations 
within the Joint Committee. The Joint Committee shall keep under review 
the possibility of further removal of the obstacles to trade between the 
EFTA States and the CSFR. 



3. The Joint Committee may take decisions in the cases provided for in 
this Agreement. On other matters the Joint Committee may make 
recommendations. 1. For the proper implementation of this Agreement the Joint Committee 
shall meet whenever necessary but at least once a year. Each State Party 
to this Agreement may request that a meeting be held. 



2. The Joint Committee shall act by common agreement. 



3. If a representative in the Joint Committee of a State Party to this 
Agreement has accepted a decision subject to the fulfilment of 
constitutional requirements, the decision shall enter into force, if no 
later date is contained therein, on the day the lifting of the reservation 
is notified. 



4. For the purpose of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall adopt its 
rules of procedure which shall, inter alia, contain provisions for 
convening meetings and for the designation of the Chairman and his term of 
office. 



5. The Joint Committee may decide to set up such sub-cormittees and 
working parties as it considers necessary to assist it in accomplishing its 
tasks. 1. Where a State Party to this Agreement considers that it would be 
useful in the interests of the economies of the States Parties to this 
Agreement to develop and deepen the relations established by the Agreement 
by extending them to fields not covered thereby, it shall submit a reasoned 
request to the States Parties to this Agreement. The States Parties to 
this Agreement may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this request 
and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with 
a view to opening negotiations. 



2. Agreements resulting from the procedure referred to in paragraph 1 
will be subject to ratification or approval by the States Parties to this 
Agreement in accordance with their own procedures. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement recognize the growing importance 
of certain areas, such as services and investments. In their efforts to 
gradually develop and broaden their co-operation, in particular in the 
context of European integration, they will co-operate with the aim of 
achieving a gradual liberalization and mutual opening of markets for 
investments and trade in services, taking into account relevant GATT work. 



2. The EFTA States and the CSFR will discuss in the Joint Committee this 
co-operation with the aim to develop and deepen their relations under the 
Agreement. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall take all necessary measures 
to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the Agreement and the 
fulfilment of their obligations under the Agreement. 



2. If an EFTA State considers that the CSFR has, or if the CSFR considers 
that an EFTA State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Agreement, 
the State Party concerned may take the appropriate measures under the 
conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 25. The Annexes and the Protocols to this Agreement are an integral part 
of it. The Joint Committee may decide to amend the Annexes, and 
Protocols A and B. 1. This Agreement applies to trade relations between, on the one side, 
the individual EFTA States and, on the other side, the CSFR, but not to the 
trade relations between individual EFTA States, except if otherwise 
provided for in this Agreement. 


2. 

(a) 

The Agreement between Finland and the CSFR on the Reciprocal 




Removal of Obstacles to Trade, signed in Helsinki on 




19 September 1974, as amended (hereinafter referred to as SF-CS Agreement), shall remain in force during a transitional period,

decision of its Parties, and the other Parties to the present 




Agreement shall be notified of this decision without delay. 


(b)

extent that these do not negatively affect the trade régime and in 
particular the provisions concerning rules of origin provided for by this 
Agreement. This Agreement shall apply to the territories of the States Parties to 
this Agreement. Amendments to this Agreement other than those referred to in 
paragraph 3 of Article 27 which are approved by the Joint Committee shall

(b) 	to provide fair conditions of competition for trade between the States Parties to this Agreement; 


(c) 	to contribute in this way, by the removal of barriers to trade, to European economic integration and to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade. This Agreement shall apply:

(b) 	to products specified in Protocol A, with due regard to the arrangements provided for in that Protocol;

The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure that any state monopoly of a commercial character be adjusted, subject to the provisions laid down in Protocol D, so that no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed will exist between nationals of the EFTA States and of Estonia.

2. The provisions of this Article shall apply to any body through which the competent authorities of the States Parties to this Agreement, in law or in fact, either directly or indirectly supervise, determine or appreciably influence imports or exports between the States Parties to this Agreement.

(a) 	to hold immediate consultations in the framework of the Joint Committee in case a State Party considers that another State Party has taken measures which are likely to create, or have created, an obstacle to trade, in order to find an appropriate solution; 


(b) 	to discuss in the Joint Committee possibilities to co-operate more closely on matters related to removing obstacles. This co-operation may take place in fields related to technical regulations and standardization as well as testing and certification.

3. Two or more States Parties to this Agreement may conclude further agreements exceeding the requirements of this Agreement, provided that such agreements shall be open to all other States Parties to this Agreement on terms equivalent to those under the agreements and that they shall be ready to enter into good faith negotiations to this end. 


4. The States Parties to this Agreement agree, upon request of an EFTA State or Estonia, to review the provisions on the protection of intellectual property rights contained in the present Article and in Annex IV, with a view to further improve levels of protection and to avoid or remedy trade distortions caused by actual levels of protection of intellectual property rights. 1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between an EFTA State and Estonia: 


(a) 	all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition; 


(b) 	abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the States Parties to this Agreement as a whole or in a substantial part thereof. 

2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to the activities of public undertakings, and undertakings for which the States Parties to this Agreement grant special or exclusive rights, in so far as the application of these provisions does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular public tasks assigned to them. 


3. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is incompatible with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). 1. Any aid granted by a State Party to this Agreement or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it may affect trade between an EFTA State and Estonia, be incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement. 


2. Any practices contrary to paragraph 1 should be assessed on the basis of the criteria set out in Annex V. 


3. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure transparency of state aid measures by exchanging information as provided in Annex VI. 


4. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is incompatible with the provisions of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). If an EFTA State finds that dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 is taking place in trade with Estonia, or if Estonia finds that dumping within this meaning is taking place in trade with an EFTA State, the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and with the procedure laid down in Article 24 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). Where any product is being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause: 


(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products in the territory of the importing State Party to this Agreement, or 


(b) 	serious disturbances in any related sector of the economy or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, 
the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). 1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the provisions of Article 4 (Customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect) may be taken by Estonia in the form of increased customs duties. 


2. These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where these difficulties produce important social problems. 


3. After the introduction of these measures, the total ad valorem customs duties applicable in Estonia to products originating in the EFTA States may not exceed 25% and shall maintain an element of preference for products originating in the EFTA States. They may not exceed customs duties levied on imports to Estonia of similar goods from any other country. The total value of imports of the products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 15% of total imports of industrial products from the EFTA States as defined in Article 2(a) during the last year for which statistics are available. 


4. These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding two years unless a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee. All exceptional measures regarding structural adjustment shall cease to apply at the latest three years after the entry into force of this Agreement. 


5. Estonia shall inform the Joint Committee of any exceptional measures it intends to take and, at the request of the EFTA States, consultations shall be held in the Joint Committee on such measures and the sectors to which they apply before they are applied. When taking such measures Estonia shall provide the Joint Committee with a schedule for the elimination of the customs duties introduced under this Article. This schedule shall provide for a phasing out of these duties at equal annual rates starting at the latest two years after their introduction. The Joint Committee may decide on a different schedule. Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 6 (Customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect) and 7 (Quantitative restrictions on imports or exports and measures having equivalent effect) leads to: 


(a) 	re-export towards a third country against which the exporting State Party to this Agreement maintains for the product concerned quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect; or 


(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to the exporting State Party to this Agreement; 
and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting State Party, that State Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). The measures shall be non-discriminatory and be eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance of payments purposes. 


2. Where an EFTA State or Estonia is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the EFTA State or Estonia, as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the Understanding on the Balance-of-Payments Provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, adopt trade restrictive measures, which shall be of limited duration and non-discriminatory, and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. Preference shall be given to price-based measureswhichshallbeprogressively relaxedasbalanceof paymentsconditionsimproveand eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. The EFTA State or Estonia, as the case may be, shall inform the other States Parties to this Agreement and the Joint Committee forthwith, if possible, prior to their introduction and shall provide a time schedule for their removal. The Joint Committee shall, upon the request of any other State Party, examine the need for maintaining the measures taken. 


3. No restrictive measures shall apply to transfers related to investments and in particular to the repatriation of amounts invested or reinvested and of any kind of revenues stemming therefrom. 1. Disputes between States Parties to this Agreement, relating to the interpretation of rights and obligations of the States Parties to this Agreement, which have not been settled through consultation or in the Joint Committee within six months, may be referred to arbitration by any State party to the dispute by means of a written notification addressed to the other State party to the dispute. A copy of this notification shall be communicated to all States Parties to this Agreement. 


2. 	The constitution and functioning of the arbitral tribunal is governed by Annex VII. 1. Before initiating the procedure for the application of safeguard measures set out in the following paragraphs of the present Article, the States Parties to this Agreement shall endeavour to solve any differences between them through direct consultations, and inform the other States Parties to this Agreement thereof. 


2. Without prejudice to paragraph 6 of the present Article, a State Party which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the other States Parties and the Joint Committee thereof and supply all relevant information. Consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution. 


3. 	(a) As regards Articles 16 (Rules of competition concerning undertakings) and 17 (State aid), the States Parties concerned shall give to the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to. If the State Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement after consultations, or after thirty days following referral for such consultations, the State Party concerned may adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from the practice in question. 


(b) 	As regards Articles 18 (Dumping), 19 (Emergency action on imports of particular products) and 21 (Re-export and serious shortage), the Joint Committee shall examine the case or the situation and may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the State Party concerned. In the absence of such a decision within thirty days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the State Party concerned may adopt the measures necessary in order to remedy the situation. 


(c) 	As regards Article 30 (Fulfilment of obligations), the State Party concerned shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a commonly acceptable solution. If the Joint Committee fails to reach such a solution or if a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures. 

4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the States Parties to this Agreement and to the Joint Committee. They shall be restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their application and shall 

not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice or the difficulty in question. Priority shall be given to such measures that will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. The measures taken by Estonia against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect the trade with that State. The measures taken against an action or omission of Estonia may be only taken by that or those EFTA States the trade of which is affected by the said action or omission. 

5. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, substitution or abolition, when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 


6. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the State Party concerned may, in the cases of Articles 18 (Dumping), 19 (Emergency action on imports of particular products) and 21 (Re-export and serious shortage) and in cases of state aid having a direct and immediate incidence on trade between the States Parties, apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation. The measures shall be notified without delay and consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place as soon as possible within the Joint Committee. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a State Party to this Agreement from taking any measures which it considers necessary: 


(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; 


(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the implementation of international obligations or national policies 


(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes, and to such traffic in other goods, materials and services as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; or 


(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and chemical weapons, nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; or 
(iii) 	taken in time of war or other serious international tension. 1. The implementation of this Agreement shall be supervised and administered by a Joint Committee which shall simultaneously act under the Declaration signed in Geneva in December 1991. 


2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of this Agreement, the States Parties to this Agreement shall exchange information and, at the request of any State Party to this Agreement, shall hold consultations within the Joint Committee. The Joint Committee shall keep under review the possibility of further removal of the obstacles to trade between the EFTA States and Estonia. 


3. The Joint Committee may take decisions in the cases provided for in this Agreement. On other matters the Joint Committee may make recommendations. 1.

2. The Joint Committee shall act by common agreement.

4. For the purpose of this Agreement the Joint Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure which shall, inter alia, contain provisions for convening meetings and for the designation of the Chairman and his/her term of office. 


5. The Joint Committee may decide to set up such sub-committees and working parties as it onsiders necessary to assist it in accomplishing its tasks. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement undertake to examine, in light of any relevant factor, the possibility of further developing and deepening the co-operation under this Agreement and to extend it to areas not covered therein. The States Parties to this Agreement may instruct the Joint Committee to examine this possibility and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them, particularly with a view to opening up negotiations. 


2. Agreementsresultingfromtheprocedurereferredtoinparagraph1willbesubjecttoratification or approval by the States Parties to this Agreement in accordance with their own procedures. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement recognize the growing importance of certain areas, such as services and investments. In their efforts to gradually develop and broaden their co-operation, in particular in the context of European integration, they will co-operate with the aim of achieving a gradual liberalization and mutual opening of markets for investments and trade in services, taking into account the results of the Uruguay Round as well as any relevant work under the auspices of the WTO. They 

will endeavour to accord to each others' operators treatment no less favourable than that accorded to other foreign operators in their territories on condition that a balance of rights and obligations as well as a balance of operating conditions exist between the individual States Parties to this Agreement. 

2. The EFTA States and Estonia will discuss this co-operation in the Joint Committee with the aim of developing and deepening their relations under this Agreement. 1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall take all necessary measures to ensure the achievement of the objectives of this Agreement and the fulfilment of their obligations under this Agreement. 


2. If an EFTA State considers that Estonia has, or if Estonia considers that an EFTA State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Agreement, the State Party concerned may take the appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 24 (Procedure for the application of safeguard measures). The Annexes and the Protocols to this Agreement are an integral part of it. The Joint Committee may decide to amend the Annexes and Protocols. 1.

................................................
This Protocol establishes the conditions, modalities and rates of achievement 
of the transitional stage referred to in article 4. of the agreement establishing 


an association between the European Economic Community and Turkey.
FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS 1. The provisions of Chapter I, Section I and of Chapter II of this part shall 
apply: 



(a) 	to goods produced in the Community or in Turkey, including those 
manufactured wholly or partly from products coming from third countries 
which are given free pratique in the Community or in Turkey; 



(b) 	to goods coming from third countries which are given free pratique in 
the Community or in Turkey. 


2. Goods given free pratique in the Commnity or in Turkey shall be deemed to be 
products coming from third countries in respect of which the necessary import
formalities have been completed and the appropriate customs duties or charges of 
equivalent effect have been levied in the Community or in Turkey, and which have 
not benefited by any total or partial drawback on such duties or charges. 



3. Goods imported from thirds countries into the Community or in Turkey under 
special customs treatment by reason of their origin or their provenance may not be 
deemed to be in free pratique when they. are re-exported to the other Contracting 
Party. However, the Association Council may, grant waivers from this rule in the 

conditions determined by it. 


4. The provisions of articles 1 and 2 shall apply only to goods exported by the 
Community or by-Turkey as from the date of signature of this Protocol. 1. 	The provisions of Chapter I, Section I and Chapter II of this Part shall apply


likewise to goods obtained in the Community or in Turkey, for whose manufacture 
products have been used which come from third countries and were not given free 
pratique in either the Community or in Turkey. Admission of the said goods under 


these provisions shall, however, be subject in the exporting State to a compensatory
levy charged at a rate equal to a percentage of the Common Customs Tariff duties 
applicable to the products from third countries used in their manufacture. The 
said percentage, which shall be fixed by the associationon Council for each period 
as it may determine, shall be based on the tariff reduction granted to the goods
in the importing State. The Association Council shall likewise determine the 
procedures for collecting the compensatory levy, taking into account the rules in 
force on the subject prior to l July 1363 in trade between the member States 


2. However, the compensatory levy shall not be charged upon the export to the 
Community or to Turkey of goods obtained in the conditions referred to in this 
Article so long as for the majority of goods imported into the other Contracting
Party, the rate of the customs duty reduction does not exceed 20 per cent, taking
into account the various rates of tariff reduction established under this Protocol. The Association Council shall define the methods of administrative co-operation 


to be followed in implementing Articles2 and 3, taking into account the methods


decided on br the Community in respect of trade in goods between the member States. 1. Any Contractign Party which considers that disparities resulting from the 
application to imports of either customs duties or quantitative restrictions, or 


any measures with equivalent effect, or of any other trade policy measure, threaten 
to divert trade or create economic difficulties on its territory, may bring *the 
matter to the notice of the associationn Council which shall, if necessary, recommend 
suitable measures for avoiding any losses which may ensue. 



2. If diversions of trade or economic difficulties arise and the Party concerned 
considers that they call for immediate action, it may itself take the necessary 
measures of protection and notify them without dela, to the association Council 
which may decide whether they must be modified or abolished. 



3. Priority of choice should be given to measures which cause the least distur
bance in the functioning of the Association and in particular in the normal development of trade. During the transitional stage, the Contracting Parties shall, to the extent 


requisite for the proper functioning of the Association, take steps to approximately
their customs laws, regulations and administrative rules, taking into account the 
approximations already effected by the States members of the Community. 1. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from introducing as between themselves 
new customs duties or charges with equivalent effect on imports and exports and 


from raising such duties as they apply in their trade relations with one another 
as from the date of entry into force of this Protocol. 


26 Nevertheless, the associationn Council may authorize the Contracting Parties 


to introduce new customs duties or charges with equivalent effect on exports if 
necessary for the attainment of the objectives of the 'greement. Customs duties on imports and charges with equivalent effect in force between 
the Community and Turkey shall be gradually abolished under the conditions laid 
down in articles 9 to 11. As from the entry into force of this Protocol, the Community shall abolish the 
customs duties and charges with equivalent effect applicable to imports from Turkey. 1. In the case of each product, the basic duty on which the successive reductions 
are to be made by Turkey, shall be the duty effectively applied towards the 
Community on the date of signature of this Protocol. 



2. The time-table of the reductions to be made by Turkey shall be fixed as follows: 
the first reduction, shall be made on the entry into force of this Protocol; the. 
second and third reductions respectively three years and five years later; the 
fourth and subsequent reductionss shall be effected each year, so that the last 
reduction is effected at the end of the transition period. 



3. bach reduction shall be made by reducing the basic duty on each, product by 
10 per cent. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 10, paragraphs 2 and 3 Turkey shall 


gradually eliminate the basic duties towards the Community over a period of twenty-
two years for the products included in annex 3, as follows: a 5 per cent reduction 
on each duty shall be made on the entry into force of this Protocol. Three further 
reductions of 5 per cent each shall be made respectively, three, six and ten years 
later. 


Eight further reductions of 10 per cent each shall be made respectively 
twelve, thirteen, fifteen, seventeen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-one and twenty-two 
years after the entry into force of this Protocol. 1. With a view to protecting the development of a new processing industry not 


existing in Turkey on the entry into force of this Protocol, or to ensuring the 
expansion of an existing processing industry, as provided for in the Turkish 
development plan in course of implementation at the moment considered, Turkey may 
make the necessary amendments to Annex 3 during the first eight years of the 
transitional stage, provided: 


-that the general body of these amendments does not affect a total value of 
imports, calculated on the basis of the figures for 1967, exceeding 10 per 
cent of imports from the Community during that same year: 


that the total value of imports from the Community of all the products 


included in annex 3, taken together and still calculated on the basis of 


the figures for 1067, is not increased, 


The products added to Annex 3 may be immediately subjected to the duties 


calculated according to the provisions of Article 11; those to which these duties 
are not applicable shall immediately be subject to the duties calculated according 
to the provisions of article 10. 



2. Turkey shall notify the Association Council of the measures it intends to take 
in accordance with the above provisions. 



3. With a view to the objective mentioned in paragraph 1 above and within the 

limit of 10 per cent of imports from the Community during 1967, the associationon 
Council may authorize Turkey, during the transitional stage, to reintroduce, 
increase or establish import customs duties on products subject to the treatment, 
provided for in .rticle 10. 


These tariff measures may not, as regards each of the items they affect, raise 
the duties applied to imports from the Community to a, level higher than 25 per cent 
ad valorem. 


4. The iAssociation Council may authorize departures from the provisions of 
paragraphs 1 and 3. 1. Irrespective of the provisions. of Articles 9 to 11, the Contracting Parties 
may suspend, wholly or in part, the levying of the duties applied to products 
imported from the other Party, the latter to be duly informed thereof, in 
particular -so far as Turkey is concerned -with a view to facilitating imports 
of certain products needed for promoting its economic development. 



2. The Contracting Parties declare their readiness to lower their customs 

duties towards each other at a faster rate than that laid down in Articles9 to 11, 
if their general economic situation and the situation of the sector concerned so 
permit.. The Association Council shall make recommendations to this affect. In the event that Turkey eliminates a charge with equivalent effect to customs 


duties vis-à-vis a third country at a faster rate than that laid down in Articles10 
and 11, the same rate shall be applied for elimination of the charge vis-à-vis the 
Community. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 7, paragraph 2, the Contracting 
Parties shall eliminate as between themselves, not later than four years after the 
entry into force of this Protocol, all customs duties on exports and charges with 
equivalent effect. 1. The provisions of Article 7, paragraph 1 and of Articles8 to 15 inclusive 


shall apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. 



2. The Community and Turkey shall notify to the Association Council, on the 
entry into force of this Protocol, their customs duties of a fiscal nature. 



3. Turkey shall retain the right to replace these customs duties of a fiscal 

nature by an internal charge in accordance with the provisions of Article 44. 


4. If the Association Council finds that the replacement of a fiscal customs 
duty meets with serious difficulties in Turkey, it shall authorize the said country 
to retain this duty, provided Turkey abolishes it not later than the end of the 
transitional stage. The Authorization must be requested within twelve months as 
from tho entry into force of this Protocol. 


Turkey may provisionally maintain the duties in question until a decision 
has been taken by the Association Council. The alignment of the Turkish customs tariff with the common customs tariff 
shall be carried out during the transitional stage in the following manner, 
starting with the duties effectively applied by Turkey to third countries at the 
:date of signature of this Protocol. 



1. In the case of products for which the duties effectively applied by Turkey 
on the above-mentioned date do not differ by more than 15 per cent in either 
direction from the duties under the common customs tariff, the latter duties shall 
be applied one year after the second reduction in customs duties referred to in 
Article 10. 



2. In other cases Turkey shall apply, one year after the second reduction in 
customs duties referred to in Article 10, duties reducing by 20 per cent the 
difference between the rata effectively applied on the date of signature of this 
Protocol and that under the common customs tariff. 



3. This difference shall be again reduced by 20 per cent. at the time of the 
fifth and seventh reductions of customs duties referred in Article 10. 



4. The common customs tariff shall be applied in its entirety at the time of the 
tenth reduction of customs duties referred to in Article 10. In dero.-ation of Article 17 and in respect of the products listed in 


to a 
in the following manner: 


Annex 3, Turkey shall prosedall. >. ..± during twenty-two year period, 



1. With respect to products on which the duties effectively applied by Turkey 
at the date of signature of this Protocol do not differ by more than 15 pet cent 
in either direction from the duties under the common customs tariff, the latter 
duties shall be applied at the, time of the fourth reduction of duties referred to 
in Article 11. 



2. In other cases, Turkey shall apply, at the time of the fourth reduction of 

duties referred to in Article 11. duties reducing by 20 per cent the difference 
between the rate effectively applied on the day of signature of this Protocol and 
that in the common customs tariff. 



3. This difference shall be again reduced by.30 and 20 per cent respectively. at 
the time of the seventh and ninth reductions referred to in Article 11. 



4. The common customstarifff chall be applied in its entirety at the end of the 
twenty-second year. 1. In the case of a certain number of products representing not more than 
10 per cent of the value of its total imports during 1967, and after consultation 
in the Association Council, Turkey shall be entitled to defer until the end of 
the twenty-second year following the entry into force of this Protocol the 


reductions of its common duties vis-à-vis third countries which it should carry 
out under Articles 17 and 18. 


2. In the case of a certain number of products representing not more than 5 per 


cent of the value of its total imports in 1967, and after consultation in the 
Association Council, Turkey shall be entitled to maintain vis-à-vis third 


countries, after a period of twenty-two years, customs duties higher than those 
under the common customs tariff. 


3. Nevertheless, the application of the provisions set forth in tho preceding 
paragraphs shall not adversely affect the free movement of goods within the 
Association and shall not constitute grounds for action by Turkey under the 
provisions of Article 5. 


4. In the event of the alignment of its customs tariff with the common customs 
tariff being accelerated, Turkey shall maintain for the benefit of the Community 
a preference equivalent to that resulting, from the machinery provided under the 
present chapter. 


With respect to the products listed in Annex 3, no such acceleration may be 
effected before the end of the transitional stage except with the prior consent 
of the Association Council. 


5. In the case of the customs duties covered by the authorization referred to 
in Article 16, paragraph 4, first sub-paragraph, or of those which Turkey is 
allowed to maintain temporarily in pursuance of Article 16, paragraph 4, second 
sub-paragraph, Turkey shall be exempted from applying the provisions of 


Articles 17 and 18. On the expiry of the authorization it shall apply the duties 
which would follow from the application of these Articles. 1. In order to facilitate imports of certain products from countries with which 


Turkey is linked by bilateral trade agreements, if the operation of. these 
agreements is substantially affected by the application of the provisions of this 


Protocol or by measures taken in pursuance of this Procotol, Turkey shall be 


entitled to grant tariff quotas at reduced rates of duty or duty free with the 


prior consent of the Association Council. 


2. Such consent shall be deemed to be granted when the tariff quotas referred 


to in the preceding paragraph meet the following conditions: 



(a) 	The total value of the quotas does not exceed annually 10 per cent of 
the .average value of Turkey' s imports from third countries during the 
three most recent years for which statistics are available, after 
deduction of imports effected with the resources referred to in Annex 4. 
This amount of 10 per cent shall be reduced by the. amount of' imports 
from third countries effected duty free under the provisions of Annex 4; 



(b) 	for each product, the import value envisaged within the framework of 
the tariff quotas does not exceed one third of the average value of 
Turkey's imports of the product from third countries during the three 
most recent years for which statistics are available. 

3. Turkey shall notify the Association Council of the measures it intends to 
take in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2. 


At the end of the transitional stage, the Association Council may decide 
whether the provisions of paragraph 2 should be abolished or amended. 


4'. In no case may the duty under a tariff quota be less than the duty effectively 
applied by Turkey to imports coming from the Community. Quantitetivrerestrictions on imports and all measures with equivalent effect 
shall; without prejudice to the following provisions, be prohibited between the 


Contracting Parties. 1. The Contracting Parties shall refrain, from introducing as between themselves 
new quantitative restrictions and measures with equivalent effect on imports. 



2. 	Nevertheless, so far as Turkey is concerned, this obligation shall apply 

upon the entry into force of this Protocol only to 35 per cent of its private 
imports from the Community in 1967. This percentage shall be raised to 40, 45, 
60 and 80 per cent, three, eight, thirteen and eighteen years respectively after 
the entry into force of this Protocol. 


3. 	Six months before each of the last three dates, the Association Council shall 


examine the consequences of the increase in the liberalization rate on Turkey's 
economic development and shall decide, if necessary to ensure accelerated economic 
development for Turkey, to extend the time-imit by a period which it shall 
determine. 



In the absence of such decision, the time-limit concerned shall be postponed
by one year. The examination procedure shall be resumed six months before the 
end of that period. A second postponement of one year shall take place if again
the Association Council does not take a decision. 


At the end of this second period, the increase in the liberalization rate 
shall be applied by Turkey, failing a decision to the contrary by the Association 
Council. 



4. The list of products liberalized for import from the Community into Turkey
shall be notified to the Community at the time of signature of this Protocol. The 
list shall be bound vis-a-vis the Community. The lists of products liberalized 
on each of the dates referred to in paragraph 2 shall be notified to the Comnunity 
and bound in respect of it. 



5. Turkey may reintroduce quantitative restrictions on imports of liberalized 
products that are not bound under this ALrticle, on condition that it opens quotas
vis-A-vis the Community equal to at least 75 per cent of the average imports from 
the Comminity during the three most recent years preceding such reintroduction. 
These quotas shall be subject to the provisions of Article 25, paragraph 24. 



6. In any case Turkey shall not apply to the Community treatment less favourable 
than to third countries. The Contracting Parties shall, in their trade with one another, refrain from 
making more: restrictive the quantitative import restrictions and measures with 
equivalent effect existing on the date of entry into force of this Protocol, 
without prejudice to the provisions of particle 22, paragraph 5. Upon the entry into force of this Protocol, the Community shall eliminate all 
quantitative restrictions on imports from Turkey. This liberalization shall be 
bound vis-a-vis Turkey. 1. Turkey shall progressively eliminate quantitative restrictions on imports 
from the Community subject to the conditions laid dowen in the following paragraphs. 



2. One your after the entry into force of this Protocol, quotas for the benefit 
of the Community shall be opened for imports of each non-libera.ized product into 
Turkey. These quotas shall be fixed at an amount equal to average imports from 
the Community in the three most recent years for which statistics are available, 
a deduction being made in respect of imports effected. 


(a) 	With special assistance resources earmarked for specified investment 
projects; 



(b) 	without foreign exchange allocations 



(c) 	within the context of the law to promote investments of foreign capital. 


3. If the imports of a non-liberalized product from the Community during the 
first year following the entry into force of this Protocol fail to reach 7 per cent 
of total imports of this product, a quota aqual to 7 per cent of such imports shall 
be established one year after the entry into force of this Protocol. 



4. 	Three years after the, entry into force of this Protocol, Turkey shall increase 

tho total volume of quotas thus fixed so as to achieve, by comparison with the 
preceding year, an increase of at least 10 per cent of their total value and at 
least 5 per cent of the value of the quota for each product. Every two years these 
values shall be increased in the same proportion as compared with the preceding 
period. 



5. Ais from the thirteenth year after the entry into force of this Protocol, each 
quota shall be increased by at least 20 per cent every two years as compared with 
the preceding period. 



6. If, during the first year after the entry into force of this Protocol, there 
have been no imports into Turkey of a non-liberalized product, the procedures for 
opening and augmenting a quota shall be determined by the Association Council. 



7. If the Association Council finds that imports of a non-liberalized product 
during two consecutive years have been appreciably less than the quota opened,
such quota may iot be taken into consideration in computing the total value of the 
quotas. In such case, Turkey shall abolish quota restrictions on such product 
imported from the Community. 



8. All quantitative restrictions on imports into Turkey must be abolished not 
later than twenty-two years as from the entry into force of this Protocol. 1. The Contracting Parties shall abolish as between themselves all measures with 
equivalent effect to quantitative import restrictions not later than the end of a 
twenty-two year period. The association Council shall recommend the gradual 
adjustments to be made during this period, taking into account the arrangements 
made within the Community. 



2. In particular,. Turkey shall progressively eliminate the deposits which 
importers are required to lodge in respect of imports of goods from the Community, 
in accordance with the schedule provided for in Articles 10 and 11. 


In addition the deposits in an amount exceeding 140 per cent of the customs 
value of goods imported from the Community, in respect of parts and accessories 
for motor vehicles falling within heading No. 87.06 of the Turkish customs tariff, 
and in an amount exceeding 120 per cent of that same value in respect 'of other 
products, shall be reduced to the levels indicated above as from the entry into 
force of this Protocol. 1. Quantitative restrictions on exports and any measures with equivalent effect 


shall be prohibited as between the Contracting Parties. 


The Community and Turkey shall abolish as between themselves, not later than 


the end of the transitional stage, the quantitative restrictions on exports and 
any measures having equivalent effect. 


2. In derogation of the foregoing paragraph the Community and Turkey, after 
consultation in the Association Council, may maintain or introduce restrictions on 
exports of basic products, to the extent necessary to encourage the development of 
certain activities of their economy or to cope with any shortage of such products. 


In such. case the Party concerned shall open in favour of the other Party a 
quota which shall take account, on the one hand, of average exports for the three 
most recent years for which statistics are available, and on the other hand of the 


normal development of trade resulting from the progressive attainment of the 


customs union. Turkey declares its readiness to remove, in respect of the Community, its 
quantitative restrictions on imports and exports at a faster rate than that laid 
down in the foregoing Articles, if its general economic situation and the 
situation of the sector concerned permit it to do so. The associationn Council 
shall make recommendations to Turkey to this end. The provisions of Articles 21 to 27 inclusive shall not prevent prohibitions 
or restrictions being imposed on imports, exports or transit on the grounds of 
public morality, public order, public security, protection of human or animal life 
or health, the preservation of plant life, the protection of national treasures 
of artistic, historical or archaeological value or the protection of industrial 



and commercial property. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, 
constitute either a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction 
on trade between the Contracting Parties. 1. The Contracting Parties shall progressively adapt the State monopolies of a 


commercial character in such a way as to ensure the exclusion, onthe expiryof a 
period of twenty-two years, of all discrimination in conditions relating to 
supplies and outlets, as between the nationals of member States of the Community 
end of Turkey. 


The provisions of this Article shall apply to any organization by means of 


which a member State or Turkey shall, de jure or de facto; either directly or 
indirectly, control, direct or appreciably influence imports or exports as between 
the Community and Turkey. These provisions shall also apply to monopolies assigned 


by the State. 


2. The Contracting Parties shall abstain from any new measure which contravenes 
the principles laid down in paragraph 1 or which limits the scope of the articles 
concerning the elimination of customs duties and quantitative restrictions between 


them. 


3. The procedures and the timing according to which the Turkish monopolies 


referred to in this Article are to be adapted and the barriers to trade between 


the Community and Turkey reduced, shall, be laid down by the Association Council 


not later than six years after the entry into force of this Protocol. 


Pending the decision of the Association Council referred to in the preceding 
paragraph, the Contracting Parties shall apply to products which are the subject 
of a monopoly in the other Contracting Party treatment no less favourable than 
that applied to the same products of the most-favoured third country. 


4. The obligations incumbent on the Contracting Parties shall be binding only in 
as far as they are compatible with existing international agreements. The system laid down, in Chapter IV for agricultural products shall be 


applicable to products subject on importation into the Community to specific 


regulations following the bringing into operation of the common agricultural 
policy. The provisions of this Protocol shall apply to agricultural products, save as 
otherwise provided in Articles 33 to 35. l. During a period of twenty-two years, Turkey shall adjust its agricultural
policy, with a view to adopting, at the end of that period, those measures of the 
common agricultural policy whose application in Turkey is indispensable for the 


establishment of the free movement of agricultural products as between the 
Community and Turkey. 


2. During the period referred to in paragraph 1, the Community shall, when 
establishing or further developing its agricultural policy, have regard to the 
interests of Turkish agriculture. Turkey shall transmit to the Community any


information required for that purpose. 


3. The Community shall notify Turkey of the Commission's proposals on the 


establishment or development of the common agricultural policy and also of the 
opinions and decisions adopted concerning these proposals. 


4. The Association Council shall decide on the communications to be made in the 


agricultural sphere by Turkey to the Community. 


5. At Association Council level, consultations may be held on the Commission's 


proposals refe-rred to in paragraph 3 -.:.nd on the measures which Turkey intends to 
adopt in the agricultural sphere pursuant to paragraph 1. 1. At the end of the period of twenty-two years, the Association Council, after 
finding that Turkey has adopted the common agricultural policy measures referred 
to in Article 33, paragraph 1, shall lay down the provisions required to ensure 
the free movement of agricultural products as between the Community and Turkeys 



2. The provisions referred to in paragraph 1 may comprise any necessary
derogation from the rules laid down by this Protocol. 



3. The Association Council may change the date referred to in paragraph 1. 1. Pending the issue of the provisions referred to in Article 34 and in derogation
of Articles 7 to 11, 15 to 18, 19, paragraphs 1 and 5, 21 to 27, and 30, the 
Community and Turkey shall accord one another, for their trade in agricultural
products, a preferential regime the scope and details of which shall be determined 


by the Association Council. 


2. However, the régime applicable from the beginning of the transitional stage is 


laid down in Annex: No. 6. 


3. One year after the entry into force of this Protocol and subsequently every 


two years, the Association Council shall, at the request. of one of the two Parties,
review the results of the preferential régime applicable to agricultural products.
It may decide on the improvements which may prove necessary in order to ensure the 


progressive achievement of the objectives of the Association Agreement. 


4. The provisions of Article 34 paragraph 2 shall apply.
MOVEMENT OF PERSONS AND SERVICES The free movement of workers beteen the States Members of the Community and 
Turkey shall be achieved gradually in conformity with the principles laid down 


in Article 12 of the Association Agreement, between the end of the twelfth and 
of the twenty second year after the entry into force of the said Agreement. 


The Association Council shall decide on the procedures to be laid down for this 
purpose. Each Member State shall accord to workers of Turkish nationality employed in 
the Community a régime characterized by the absence of any discrimination based on 
nationality in relation to workers nationals of other States Members of the 
Community as regards working conditions and remuneration. Pending the gradual achievement of the free movement of workers as between the 


StatesMembers of the Community and Turkey, the Association Council may examine 
all questions raised by the geographical and occupational mobility of workers of 



Turkish nationality, including more particularly the renewal of work and residence 
permits, with a view to facilitating the employment of such workers in each Member 


State. 


To that end, the Association Council may make recommendations to Member States. 1. Before the end of the first year after the entry into force of this Protocol, 
the Association Council shall lay down social security provisions for workers 
of Turkish nationality moving within the Community and for their families resident 
in the Community. 



2. These provisions shall enable workers of Turkish nationality, on conditions 
to be laid down, to have taken into account all periods of insurance or employment 
in the various Member States as regards pension and old-age, death and disability 
benefits and also medical care of workers and their families residing in the 
Community. These provisions shall not establish an obligation for States Members 
of the Community to take into account periods of insurance or employment in Turkey. 



3. The provisions referred to above must be such as to ensure payment of family 
allowances where the worker's family resides in the Community. 



4. Pension and old-age, death and disability benefits obtained by virtue of the 

provisions laid down in pursuance of paragraph 2 shall be transferable to Turkey. 


5. The provisions of this Article shall not affect the rights and obligations 
deriving from existing bilateral agreements between Turkey and States Members of 
the Community, where such agreements provide a more favourable regime for Turkish 
nationals. The Association Council may make recommendations to Member States and to 
Turkey in order to promote exchanges of young workers on the basis of the methods 
adopted by Member States in application of Article 50 of the Treaty establishing 
the Community. 1. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from introducing as between themselves 
new restrictions on the freedom of establishment and the free supply of services. 



2. The Association Council shall, in accordance with the principles laid down 
in Articles 13 and 14 of the Association Agreement, determine the rate at which 
and the conditions under which, the Contracting Parties shall progressively abolish 
as between them any restrictions on the freedom of establishment and the free supply

of services. 


The Association Council shall determine this rate and these conditions for 
the various categories of activity, having regard to the analagous arrangements
already made by the Community in these matters and also the special economic and 
social situation of Turkey. Priority shall be accorded to activities contributing 
more particularly to the development of production and trade. 1. The Association Council shall, on conditions to be laid down by it, having 
regard in particular to the geographical situation of Turkey, extend to Turkey
the clauses dealing with transport in the Treaty establishing the Community. It 


may, on the same conditions, extend to Turkey the action taken by the Community
in application of these clauses to rail, road and waterway Transport. 


2. If the Community, in pursuance of Article 84, paragraph 2, of the Treaty 


establishing the Cormunity, adopts provisions concerning maritime and air transport,


the Association Council shall decide whether, to what extent., and by what procedure
regulations may be enacted for Turkish maritimie and air transport.
APPROXIMATION OF ECONOMIC POLICIES 1. The Association Council shall, within six years from the entry into force of 
this Protocol, lay down the conditions and procedures governing the application of 
the principles referred to in Articles 85, 86, 90 and 92 of the Treaty establishing


the Community. 



2. During the transitional period, Turkey may be deemed to be in the situation 
referred to in Article 92, paragraph 3(a) of the Treaty establishing the Community.
Aids designed to promote Turkey's economic development shall therefore, to the exten 
to which they do not affect trading conditions to a degree contrary to the common 
interest of the Contracting Parties, be deemed compatible with the proper functioning


of the Association. 


At the end of the transitional stage, the Association Council shall, with due 
regard to the economic situation of Turkey at that date, decide whether it is 
necessary to extend the operation of the provisions of the preceding sub-paragraph, 1. A Contracting Party shall not impose, directly or indirectly, on the products


of the other Contracting Party, any internal charges of any kind whatsoever in 
excess of those directly or indirectly imposed on like domestic products. 


A Contracting Party shall not impose on the products of the other Contracting
Party internal charges such as would afford indirect protection to other productions 


The Contracting Parties shall, not later than the beginning of the third year
after the entry into force of this Protocol, eliminate the provisions that exist
